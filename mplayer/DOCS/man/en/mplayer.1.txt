DESCRIPTION
       mplayer is a movie player for Linux (runs on many other  platforms  and
       CPU  architectures,  see  the  documentation).  It plays most MPEG/VOB,
       AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV, RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo,
       yuv4mpeg,  FILM  and  RoQ  files,  supported  by many native and binary
       codecs.  You can watch VCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5, WMV  and  even
       H.264 movies, too.

       MPlayer  supports  a  wide range of video and audio output drivers.  It
       works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,  AAlib,  libcaca,  Di-
       rectFB,  Quartz, Mac OS X CoreVideo, but you can also use GGI, SDL (and
       all their drivers), VESA (on every VESA-compatible card,  even  without
       X11),  some  low-level card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3dfx and ATI)
       and some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens  DVB,  Haup-
       pauge PVR (IVTV), DXR2 and DXR3/Hollywood+.  Most of them support soft-
       ware or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen mode.

       MPlayer has an onscreen display (OSD) for status information, nice  big
       antialiased shaded subtitles and visual feedback for keyboard controls.
       European/ISO8859-1,2 (Hungarian, English, Czech, etc), Cyrillic and Ko-
       rean fonts are supported along with 12 subtitle formats (MicroDVD, Sub-
       Rip, OGM, SubViewer, Sami, VPlayer, RT, SSA, AQTitle, JACOsub, PJS  and
       our  own: MPsub) and DVD subtitles (SPU streams, VOBsub and Closed Cap-
       tions).

       mencoder (MPlayer's Movie Encoder) is a simple movie encoder,  designed
       to encode MPlayer-playable movies (see above) to other MPlayer-playable
       formats (see below).  It encodes to  MPEG-4  (DivX/Xvid),  one  of  the
       libavcodec  codecs  and PCM/MP3/VBRMP3 audio in 1, 2 or 3 passes.  Fur-
       thermore it has stream copying  abilities,  a  powerful  filter  system
       (crop, expand, flip, postprocess, rotate, scale, noise, RGB/YUV conver-
       sion) and more.

       gmplayer is MPlayer with a graphical user interface.  It has  the  same
       options  as  MPlayer,  however they might not all work correctly due to
       conflicts with the configuration via the GUI (stored in gui.conf).   In
       particular  some  options  might be overwritten by settings in gui.conf
       while others might end up stored permanently in gui.conf.

       Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at  the  end  of
       this man page.

       Also see the HTML documentation!

INTERACTIVE CONTROL
       MPlayer  has  a  fully configurable, command-driven control layer which
       allows you to control MPlayer using keyboard, mouse, joystick or remote
       control (with LIRC).  See the -input option for ways to customize it.

USAGE
       Every 'flag' option has a 'noflag' counterpart, e.g.  the  opposite  of
       the -fs option is -nofs.

       If  an option is marked as (XXX only), it will only work in combination
       with the XXX option or if XXX is compiled in.

       NOTE: The suboption parser (used for example for  -ao  pcm  suboptions)
       supports a special kind of string-escaping intended for use with exter-
       nal GUIs.
       It has the following format:
       %n%string_of_length_n
       EXAMPLES:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%10%C:test.wav test.avi
       Or in a script:
       mplayer -ao pcm:file=%`expr length "$NAME"`%"$NAME" test.avi


CONFIGURATION FILES
       You can put all of the options in configuration  files  which  will  be
       read every time MPlayer/MEncoder is run.  The system-wide configuration
       file 'mplayer.conf' is in  your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  /etc/
       mplayer or /usr/local/etc/mplayer), the user specific one is '~/.mplay-
       er/config'.  The configuration file for MEncoder is 'mencoder.conf'  in
       your  configuration  directory  (e.g.  /etc/mplayer  or /usr/local/etc/
       mplayer), the user specific one  is  '~/.mplayer/mencoder.conf'.   User
       specific  options override system-wide options and options given on the
       command line override either.  The syntax of the configuration files is
       'option=<value>',  everything after a '#' is considered a comment.  Op-
       tions that work without values can be enabled by setting them to  'yes'
       or  '1'  or  'true'  and  disabled  by  setting  them to 'no' or '0' or
       'false'.  Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

       You can also write file-specific configuration files.  If you  wish  to
       have  a configuration file for a file called 'movie.avi', create a file
       named 'movie.avi.conf' with the file-specific options in it and put  it
       in  ~/.mplayer/.   You  can also put the configuration file in the same
       directory  as  the  file  to  be  played,  as  long  as  you  give  the
       -use-filedir-conf  option (either on the command line or in your global
       config file).  If a file-specific configuration file is  found  in  the
       same directory, no file-specific configuration is loaded from ~/.mplay-
       er.  In addition, the -use-filedir-conf option  enables  directory-spe-
       cific  configuration  files.   For  this, MPlayer first tries to load a
       mplayer.conf from the same directory as the file played and then  tries
       to load any file-specific configuration.

       EXAMPLE MPLAYER CONFIGURATION FILE:

       # Use Matrox driver by default.
       vo=xmga
       # I love practicing handstands while watching videos.
       flip=yes
       # Decode/encode multiple files from PNG,
       # start with mf://filemask
       mf=type=png:fps=25
       # Eerie negative images are cool.
       vf=eq2=1.0:-0.8

       EXAMPLE MENCODER CONFIGURATION FILE:

       # Make MEncoder output to a default filename.
       o=encoded.avi
       # The next 4 lines allow mencoder tv:// to start capturing immediately.
       oac=pcm=yes

PROFILES
       To  ease  working with different configurations profiles can be defined
       in the configuration files.  A profile starts  with  its  name  between
       square  brackets,  e.g.  '[my-profile]'.  All following options will be
       part of the profile.  A description (shown by -profile help) can be de-
       fined  with the profile-desc option.  To end the profile, start another
       one or use the profile name 'default' to continue with normal  options.

       EXAMPLE MPLAYER PROFILE:


       [protocol.dvd]
       profile-desc="profile for dvd:// streams"
       vf=pp=hb/vb/dr/al/fd
       alang=en

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -codecs-file <filename> (also see -afm, -ac, -vfm, -vc)
              Override the standard search path and use the specified file in-
              stead of the builtin codecs.conf.

       -include <configuration file>
              Specify configuration file to be parsed after the default  ones.

       -list-options
              Prints all available options.

       -msgcharset <charset>
              Convert  console  messages  to  the specified character set (de-
              fault: autodetect).  Text will be in the encoding specified with
              the --charset configure option.  Set this to "noconv" to disable
              conversion (for e.g. iconv problems).
              NOTE: The option takes effect after  command  line  parsing  has
              finished.  The MPLAYER_CHARSET environment variable can help you
              get rid of the first lines of garbled output.

       -msgcolor
              Enable colorful console output on terminals  that  support  ANSI
              color.

       -msglevel <all=<level>:<module>=<level>:...>
              Control  verbosity  directly  for each module.  The 'all' module
              changes the verbosity of all the modules not  explicitly  speci-
              fied  on  the  command line.  See '-msglevel help' for a list of
              all modules.
              NOTE: Some messages are  printed  before  the  command  line  is
              parsed  and are therefore not affected by -msglevel.  To control
              these messages you have to use the  MPLAYER_VERBOSE  environment
              variable, see its description below for details.
              Available levels:
                 -1   complete silence
                  0   fatal messages only
                  1   error messages
                  2   warning messages
                  3   short hints
                  4   informational messages
                  5   status messages (default)
                  6   verbose messages
                  7   debug level 2
                  8   debug level 3
                  9   debug level 4

       -msgmodule
              Prepend module name in front of each console message.

       -noconfig <options>
              Do not parse selected configuration files.
              NOTE:  If -include or -use-filedir-conf options are specified at
              the command line, they will be honoured.

              Available options are:
                 all
                      all configuration files
                 gui (GUI only)
                      GUI configuration file
                 system
                      system configuration file
                 user
                      user configuration file

       -quiet
              Make console output less verbose; in  particular,  prevents  the
              status  line (i.e. A:   0.7 V:   0.6 A-V:  0.068 ...) from being
              displayed.  Particularly useful on slow terminals or broken ones
              which do not properly handle carriage return (i.e. \r).

       -priority <prio> (Windows and OS/2 only)
              Set  process  priority  for  MPlayer according to the predefined
              priorities available under Windows and OS/2.  Possible values of
              <prio>:
                 idle|belownormal|normal|abovenormal|high|realtime

              WARNING: Using realtime priority can cause system lockup.

       -profile <profile1,profile2,...>
              Use  the  given profile(s), -profile help displays a list of the
              defined profiles.

       -really-quiet (also see -quiet)
              Display even less output and status messages than  with  -quiet.
              Also suppresses the GUI error message boxes.

       -show-profile <profile>
              Show the description and content of a profile.

       -use-filedir-conf
              Look for a file-specific configuration file in the same directo-
              ry as the file that is being played.
              WARNING: May be dangerous if playing from untrusted media.

       -v
              Increment verbosity level, one level for each -v  found  on  the
              command line.

PLAYER OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -autoq <quality> (use with -vf [s]pp)
              Dynamically changes the level of postprocessing depending on the
              available spare CPU time.  The number you specify  will  be  the
              maximum  level  used.  Usually you can use some big number.  You
              have to use -vf [s]pp without parameters in order  for  this  to
              work.

       -autosync <factor>
              Gradually  adjusts  the  A/V  sync based on audio delay measure-
              ments.  Specifying -autosync 0, the default,  will  cause  frame
              timing to be based entirely on audio delay measurements.  Speci-
              fying -autosync 1 will do the same, but will subtly  change  the
              A/V  correction algorithm.  An uneven video framerate in a movie
              which plays fine with -nosound can often be  helped  by  setting
              this  to an integer value greater than 1.  The higher the value,
              the closer the timing will be to -nosound.  Try -autosync 30  to
              smooth  out problems with sound drivers which do not implement a
              perfect audio delay measurement.  With this value, if large  A/V
              sync  offsets occur, they will only take about 1 or 2 seconds to
              settle out.  This delay in reaction time to sudden  A/V  offsets
              should  be  the  only side-effect of turning this option on, for
              all sound drivers.

       -benchmark
              Prints some statistics on CPU usage and dropped  frames  at  the
              end  of playback.  Use in combination with -nosound and -vo null
              for benchmarking only the video codec.
              NOTE: With this option MPlayer will also ignore  frame  duration
              when playing only video (you can think of that as infinite fps).

       -colorkey <number>
              Changes the colorkey to an RGB value of your  choice.   0x000000
              is  black  and 0xffffff is white.  Only supported by the cvidix,
              fbdev, svga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix, xover,  xv  (see  -vo
              xv:ck), xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       -nocolorkey
              Disables  colorkeying.  Only supported by the cvidix, fbdev, sv-
              ga, vesa, winvidix, xmga, xvidix, xover,  xv  (see  -vo  xv:ck),
              xvmc (see -vo xv:ck) and directx video output drivers.

       -correct-pts (EXPERIMENTAL)
              Switches  MPlayer  to  an experimental mode where timestamps for
              video frames are calculated differently and video filters  which
              add  new  frames  or modify timestamps of existing ones are sup-
              ported.  The more accurate timestamps can be visible for example
              when  playing subtitles timed to scene changes with the -ass op-
              tion.  Without -correct-pts the subtitle timing  will  typically
              be off by some frames.  This option does not work correctly with
              some demuxers and codecs.

       -crash-debug (DEBUG CODE)
              Automatically attaches gdb upon crash or SIGTRAP.  Support  must
              be compiled in by configuring with --enable-crash-debug.

       -doubleclick-time
              Time in milliseconds to recognize two consecutive button presses
              as a double-click (default: 300).  Set to 0 to let your  window-
              ing system decide what a double-click is (-vo directx only).
              NOTE:  You  will  get  slightly different behaviour depending on
              whether you bind MOUSE_BTN0_DBL or MOUSE_BTN0-MOUSE_BTN0_DBL.

       -edlout <filename>
              Creates a new file and writes edit decision list  (EDL)  records
              to  it.  During playback, the user hits 'i' to mark the start or
              end of a skip block.  This provides a starting point from  which
              the user can fine-tune EDL entries later.  See http://www.mplay-
              erhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details.

       -enqueue (GUI only)
              Enqueue files given on the command line in the playlist  instead
              of playing them immediately.

       -fixed-vo
              Enforces  a  fixed video system for multiple files (one (un)ini-
              tialization for all files).  Therefore only one window  will  be
              opened  for  all  files.   Currently  the  following drivers are
              fixed-vo compliant: gl, gl2, mga, svga, x11,  xmga,  xv,  xvidix
              and dfbmga.

       -framedrop  (also  see  -hardframedrop,  experimental  without  -nocor-
       rect-pts)
              Skip  displaying  some  frames to maintain A/V sync on slow sys-
              tems.  Video filters are not applied to  such  frames.   For  B-
              frames even decoding is skipped completely.

       -(no)gui
              Enable  or  disable the GUI interface (default depends on binary
              name).  Only works as the first argument on  the  command  line.
              Does not work as a config-file option.

       -h, -help, --help
              Show short summary of options.

       -hardframedrop (experimental without -nocorrect-pts)
              More  intense  frame dropping (breaks decoding).  Leads to image
              distortion!  Note that especially the libmpeg2 decoder may crash
              with this, so consider using "-vc ffmpeg12,".

       -heartbeat-cmd
              Command  that  is  executed every 30 seconds during playback via
              system() - i.e. using the shell.

              NOTE: MPlayer uses this command without any checking, it is your
              responsibility  to  ensure  it  does not cause security problems
              (e.g. make sure to use full paths if "." is in your path like on
              Windows).   It also only works when playing video (i.e. not with
              -novideo but works with -vo null).

              This can be "misused" to disable screensavers that do  not  sup-
              port  the  proper  X  API (also see -stop-xscreensaver).  If you
              think this is too complicated, ask the author of the screensaver
              program to support the proper X APIs.

              EXAMPLE   for  xscreensaver:  mplayer  -heartbeat-cmd  "xscreen-
              saver-command -deactivate" file

              EXAMPLE   for   GNOME   screensaver:   mplayer    -heartbeat-cmd
              "gnome-screensaver-command -p" file

       -identify
              Shorthand  for -msglevel identify=4.  Show file parameters in an
              easily parseable format.  Also prints more detailed  information
              about subtitle and audio track languages and IDs.  In some cases
              you can get more information by using -msglevel identify=6.  For
              example,  for a DVD it will list the chapters and time length of
              each title, as well as a disk ID.  Combine this with  -frames  0
              to  suppress  all output.  The wrapper script TOOLS/midentify.sh
              suppresses the other MPlayer output and (hopefully) shellescapes
              the filenames.

       -idle (also see -slave)
              Makes  MPlayer  wait  idly  instead of quitting when there is no
              file to play.  Mostly useful in slave mode where MPlayer can  be
              controlled through input commands.

       -input <commands>
              This  option can be used to configure certain parts of the input
              system.  Paths are relative to ~/.mplayer/.
              NOTE: Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.

              Available commands are:

                 conf=<filename>
                      Specify input configuration file other than the  default
                      ~/.mplayer/input.conf.  ~/.mplayer/<filename> is assumed
                      if no full path is given.
                 ar-dev=<device>
                      Device to be used for Apple IR Remote  (default  is  au-
                      todetected, Linux only).
                 ar-delay
                      Delay  in  milliseconds  before we start to autorepeat a
                      key (0 to disable).
                 ar-rate
                      Number of key presses to generate per second on  autore-
                      peat.
                 (no)default-bindings
                      Use the key bindings that MPlayer ships with by default.
                 keylist
                      Prints all keys that can be bound to commands.
                 cmdlist
                      Prints all commands that can be bound to keys.
                 js-dev
                      Specifies the joystick device to use (default:  /dev/in-
                      put/js0).
                 file=<filename>
                      Read commands from the given file.  Mostly useful with a
                      FIFO.
                      NOTE: When the given file is a FIFO MPlayer  opens  both
                      ends  so  you  can do several 'echo "seek 10" > mp_pipe'
                      and the pipe will stay valid.

       -key-fifo-size <2-65000>
              Specify the size of the FIFO that buffers key  events  (default:
              7).   A  FIFO  of  size n can buffer (n-1) events.  If it is too
              small some events may be lost (leading to "stuck mouse  buttons"
              and  similar  effects).   If  it is too big, MPlayer may seem to
              hang while it processes the buffered events.  To  get  the  same
              behavior  as  before this option was introduced, set it to 2 for
              Linux or 1024 for Windows.

       -lircconf <filename> (LIRC only)
              Specifies a configuration file for LIRC (default: ~/.lircrc).

       -list-properties
              Print a list of the available properties.

       -loop <number>
              Loops movie playback <number> times.  0 means forever.

       -menu (OSD menu only)
              Turn on OSD menu support.

       -menu-cfg <filename> (OSD menu only)
              Use an alternative menu.conf.

       -menu-chroot <path> (OSD menu only)
              Chroot the file selection menu to a specific location.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -menu-chroot /home
                      Will restrict the file selection menu to /home and down-
                      ward  (i.e.  no  access  to  /  will  be  possible,  but
                      /home/user_name will).

       -menu-keepdir (OSD menu only)
              File browser starts from the last known location instead of cur-
              rent directory.

       -menu-root <value> (OSD menu only)
              Specify the main menu.

       -menu-startup (OSD menu only)
              Display the main menu at MPlayer startup.

       -mouse-movements
              Permit  MPlayer  to receive pointer events reported by the video
              output driver.  Necessary to select the buttons  in  DVD  menus.
              Supported  for  X11-based  VOs  (x11, xv, xvmc, etc) and the gl,
              gl2, direct3d and corevideo VOs.

       -noar  Turns off AppleIR remote support.

       -noconsolecontrols
              Prevent MPlayer from reading key  events  from  standard  input.
              Useful when reading data from standard input.  This is automati-
              cally enabled when - is found on the command  line.   There  are
              situations  where  you have to set it manually, e.g. if you open
              /dev/stdin (or the equivalent on your system), use  stdin  in  a
              playlist  or intend to read from stdin later on via the loadfile
              or loadlist slave commands.

       -nojoystick
              Turns off joystick support.

       -nolirc
              Turns off LIRC support.

       -nomouseinput
              Disable mouse button press/release input (mozplayerxp's  context
              menu relies on this option).

       -rtc (RTC only)
              Turns  on  usage of the Linux RTC (realtime clock - /dev/rtc) as
              timing mechanism.  This wakes up the process every  1/1024  sec-
              onds  to check the current time.  Useless with modern Linux ker-
              nels configured for desktop use as they already wake up the pro-
              cess with similar accuracy when using normal timed sleep.

       -playing-msg <string>
              Print  out a string before starting playback.  The following ex-
              pansions are supported:

                 ${NAME}
                      Expand to the value of the property NAME.

                 ?(NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is available.

                 ?(!NAME:TEXT)
                      Expand TEXT only if the property NAME is not  available.

       -playlist <filename>
              Play  files  according to a playlist file (ASX, Winamp, SMIL, or
              one-file-per-line format).
              NOTE: This option is considered an entry so options found  after
              it will apply only to the elements of this playlist.
              FIXME: This needs to be clarified and documented thoroughly.

       -rtc-device <device>
              Use the specified device for RTC timing.

       -shuffle
              Play files in random order.

       -skin <name> (GUI only)
              Loads a skin from the directory given as parameter below the de-
              fault  skin   directories,   /usr/local/share/mplayer/skins/ and
              ~/.mplayer/skins/.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -skin fittyfene
                      Tries  /usr/local/share/mplayer/skins/fittyfene  and af-
                      terwards ~/.mplayer/skins/fittyfene.

       -slave (also see -input)
              Switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend  for
              other programs.  Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlay-
              er will read commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.
              NOTE: See -input cmdlist  for  a  list  of  slave  commands  and
              DOCS/tech/slave.txt  for  their  description.  Also, this is not
              intended to disable other inputs, e.g. via the video window, use
              some other method like -input nodefault-binds:conf=/dev/null for
              that.

       -softsleep
              Time frames by repeatedly checking the current time  instead  of
              asking  the kernel to wake up MPlayer at the correct time.  Use-
              ful if your kernel timing is imprecise and you  cannot  use  the
              RTC either.  Comes at the price of higher CPU consumption.

       -sstep <sec>
              Skip  <sec>  seconds after every frame.  The normal framerate of
              the movie is kept, so playback is  accelerated.   Since  MPlayer
              can only seek to the next keyframe this may be inexact.

DEMUXER/STREAM OPTIONS
       -a52drc <level>
              Select  the  Dynamic  Range  Compression  level  for  AC-3 audio
              streams.  <level> is a float value ranging from 0 to 1, where  0
              means  no  compression  and  1 (which is the default) means full
              compression (make loud passages more  silent  and  vice  versa).
              This option only shows an effect if the AC-3 stream contains the
              required range compression information.

       -aid <ID> (also see -alang)
              Select audio channel (MPEG: 0-31, AVI/OGM: 1-99, ASF/RM:  0-127,
              VOB(AC-3):   128-159,   VOB(LPCM):  160-191,  MPEG-TS  17-8190).
              MPlayer prints the available audio IDs when run in verbose  (-v)
              mode.  When playing an MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder will use
              the first program (if present) with the chosen audio stream.

       -ausid <ID> (also see -alang)
              Select audio substream channel.  Currently the  valid  range  is
              0x55..0x75  and  applies only to MPEG-TS when handled by the na-
              tive demuxer (not by libavformat).  The format type may  not  be
              correctly  identified  because  of how this information (or lack
              thereof) is embedded in the stream, but it will demux  correctly
              the audio streams when multiple substreams are present.  MPlayer
              prints the available substream IDs when run with -identify.

       -alang <language code[,language code,...]> (also see -aid)
              Specify a priority list of audio languages  to  use.   Different
              container formats employ different language codes.  DVDs use ISO
              639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska, MPEG-TS and  NUT  use
              ISO 639-2 three letter language codes while OGM uses a free-form
              identifier.  MPlayer prints the available languages when run  in
              verbose (-v) mode.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer dvd://1 -alang hu,en
                      Chooses  the Hungarian language track on a DVD and falls
                      back on English if Hungarian is not available.
                 mplayer -alang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file in Japanese.

       -audio-demuxer <[+]name> (-audiofile only)
              Force audio demuxer type for -audiofile.  Use a '+'  before  the
              name  to force it, this will skip some checks!  Give the demuxer
              name as printed by -audio-demuxer help.  For  backward  compati-
              bility  it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/
              demuxer.h.  -audio-demuxer audio  or  -audio-demuxer  17  forces
              MP3.

       -audiofile <filename>
              Play  audio from an external file (WAV, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis) while
              viewing a movie.

       -audiofile-cache <kBytes>
              Enables caching for the stream used  by  -audiofile,  using  the
              specified amount of memory.

       -reuse-socket (udp:// only)
              Allows a socket to be reused by other processes as soon as it is
              closed.

       -bandwidth <Bytes> (network only)
              Specify the maximum bandwidth for network streaming (for servers
              that are able to send content in different bitrates).  Useful if
              you want to watch live streamed media behind a slow  connection.
              With Real RTSP streaming, it is also used to set the maximum de-
              livery bandwidth allowing faster cache filling and stream  dump-
              ing.

       -cache <kBytes>
              This  option  specifies  how much memory (in kBytes) to use when
              precaching a file or URL.  Especially useful on slow media.

       -nocache
              Turns off caching.

       -cache-min <percentage>
              Playback will start when the cache has been filled up  to  <per-
              centage> of the total.

       -cache-seek-min <percentage>
              If a seek is to be made to a position within <percentage> of the
              cache size from the current position, MPlayer will wait for  the
              cache  to  be  filled  to this position rather than performing a
              stream seek (default: 50).

       -cdda <option1:option2> (CDDA only)
              This option can be used to tune the CD Audio reading feature  of
              MPlayer.

              Available options are:

                 speed=<value>
                      Set CD spin speed.

                 paranoia=<0-2>
                      Set  paranoia  level.  Values other than 0 seem to break
                      playback of anything but the first track.
                         0: disable checking (default)
                         1: overlap checking only
                         2: full data correction and verification

                 generic-dev=<value>
                      Use specified generic SCSI device.

                 sector-size=<value>
                      Set atomic read size.

                 overlap=<value>
                      Force minimum  overlap  search  during  verification  to
                      <value> sectors.

                 toc-bias
                      Assume  that the beginning offset of track 1 as reported
                      in the TOC will be addressed as  LBA  0.   Some  Toshiba
                      drives need this for getting track boundaries correct.

                 toc-offset=<value>
                      Add <value> sectors to the values reported when address-
                      ing tracks.  May be negative.

                 (no)skip
                      (Never) accept imperfect data reconstruction.

       -cdrom-device <path to device>
              Specify the CD-ROM device (default: /dev/cdrom).

       -channels <number> (also see -af channels)
              Request the number of playback channels (default:  2).   MPlayer
              asks  the  decoder  to decode the audio into as many channels as
              specified.  Then it is up to the decoder to fulfill the require-
              ment.   This  is usually only important when playing videos with
              AC-3 audio (like DVDs).  In that case liba52 does  the  decoding
              by  default and correctly downmixes the audio into the requested
              number of channels.  To directly control the  number  of  output
              channels independently of how many channels are decoded, use the
              channels filter.
              NOTE: This option is honored  by  codecs  (AC-3  only),  filters
              (surround) and audio output drivers (OSS at least).

              Available options are:

                 2    stereo
                 4    surround
                 6    full 5.1
                 8    full 7.1

       -chapter <chapter ID>[-<endchapter ID>] (dvd:// and dvdnav:// only)
              Specify  which  chapter to start playing at.  Optionally specify
              which chapter to end playing at (default: 1).

       -cookies (network only)
              Send cookies when making HTTP requests.

       -cookies-file <filename> (network only)
              Read HTTP cookies  from  <filename>  (default:  ~/.mozilla/  and
              ~/.netscape/) and skip reading from default locations.  The file
              is assumed to be in Netscape format.

       -delay <sec>
              audio delay in seconds (positive or negative float value)
              Negative values delay the audio, and positive values  delay  the
              video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of the -audio-delay
              MEncoder option.
              NOTE: When used with MEncoder, this is not  guaranteed  to  work
              correctly with -ovc copy; use -audio-delay instead.

       -ignore-start
              Ignore the specified starting time for streams in AVI files.  In
              MPlayer, this nullifies stream delays in files encoded with  the
              -audio-delay option.  During encoding, this option prevents MEn-
              coder from transferring original stream start times to  the  new
              file;  the  -audio-delay option is not affected.  Note that MEn-
              coder sometimes adjusts stream starting times  automatically  to
              compensate  for  anticipated decoding delays, so do not use this
              option for encoding without testing it first.

       -demuxer <[+]name>
              Force demuxer type.  Use a '+' before the name to force it, this
              will skip some checks!  Give the demuxer name as printed by -de-
              muxer help.  For backward compatibility it also accepts the  de-
              muxer ID as defined in libmpdemux/demuxer.h.

       -dumpaudio (MPlayer only)
              Dumps  raw compressed audio stream to ./stream.dump (useful with
              MPEG/AC-3, in most other cases the resulting file  will  not  be
              playable).  If you give more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       -dumpfile <filename> (MPlayer only)
              Specify which file MPlayer should dump to.  Should be  used  to-
              gether with -dumpaudio / -dumpvideo / -dumpstream.

       -dumpstream (MPlayer only)
              Dumps the raw stream to ./stream.dump.  Useful when ripping from
              DVD or network.  If  you  give  more  than  one  of  -dumpaudio,
              -dumpvideo,  -dumpstream  on  the command line only the last one
              will work.

       -dumpvideo (MPlayer only)
              Dump raw compressed video stream to ./stream.dump (not very  us-
              able).   If  you  give  more than one of -dumpaudio, -dumpvideo,
              -dumpstream on the command line only the last one will work.

       -dvbin <options> (DVB only)
              Pass the following parameters to the DVB input module, in  order
              to override the default ones:

                 card=<1-4>
                      Specifies using card number 1-4 (default: 1).
                 file=<filename>
                      Instructs  MPlayer to read the channels list from <file-
                      name>.         Default        is        ~/.mplayer/chan-
                      nels.conf.{sat,ter,cbl,atsc}  (based  on your card type)
                      or ~/.mplayer/channels.conf as a last resort.
                 timeout=<1-30>
                      Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying to tune  a
                      frequency before giving up (default: 30).

       -dvd-device <path to device> (DVD only)
              Specify  the  DVD  device  or .iso filename (default: /dev/dvd).
              You can also specify a directory that contains files  previously
              copied directly from a DVD (with e.g. vobcopy).

       -dvd-speed <factor or speed in KB/s> (DVD only)
              Try  to limit DVD speed (default: 0, no change).  DVD base speed
              is about 1350KB/s, so a 8x  drive  can  read  at  speeds  up  to
              10800KB/s.   Slower speeds make the drive more quiet, for watch-
              ing DVDs 2700KB/s should be quiet and fast enough.  MPlayer  re-
              sets the speed to the drive default value on close.  Values less
              than 100 mean multiples of 1350KB/s, i.e. -dvd-speed  8  selects
              10800KB/s.
              NOTE:  You  need  write  access  to the DVD device to change the
              speed.

       -dvdangle <angle ID> (DVD only)
              Some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed  from  multiple
              angles.  Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use (default:
              1).

       -edl <filename>
              Enables edit decision list (EDL) actions during playback.  Video
              will be skipped over and audio will be muted and unmuted accord-
              ing to the entries in the given file.   See  http://www.mplayer-
              hq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/edl.html for details on how to use this.

       -endpos <[[hh:]mm:]ss[.ms]|size[b|kb|mb]> (also see -ss and -sb)
              Stop at given time or byte position.
              NOTE: Byte position is enabled only for MEncoder and will not be
              accurate, as it can only stop at a frame boundary.  When used in
              conjunction  with -ss option, -endpos time will shift forward by
              seconds specified with -ss.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 56 seconds.
                 -endpos 01:10:00
                      Stop at 1 hour 10 minutes.
                 -ss 10 -endpos 56
                      Stop at 1 minute 6 seconds.
                 -endpos 100mb
                      Encode only 100 MB.

       -forceidx
              Force index rebuilding.  Useful for files with broken index (A/V
              desync,  etc).   This will enable seeking in files where seeking
              was not possible.  You can fix the index permanently  with  MEn-
              coder (see the documentation).
              NOTE:  This  option  only works if the underlying media supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       -fps <float value>
              Override video framerate.  Useful if the original value is wrong
              or missing.

       -frames <number>
              Play/convert only first <number> frames, then quit.

       -hr-mp3-seek (MP3 only)
              Hi-res  MP3  seeking.  Enabled when playing from an external MP3
              file, as we need to seek to the very exact position to keep  A/V
              sync.   Can  be  slow especially when seeking backwards since it
              has to rewind to the beginning to find an exact frame  position.

       -idx (also see -forceidx)
              Rebuilds index of files if no index was found, allowing seeking.
              Useful with broken/incomplete downloads, or badly created files.
              NOTE:  This  option  only works if the underlying media supports
              seeking (i.e. not with stdin, pipe, etc).

       -noidx Skip rebuilding index file.  MEncoder skips  writing  the  index
              with this option.

       -ipv4-only-proxy (network only)
              Skip  the  proxy  for IPv6 addresses.  It will still be used for
              IPv4 connections.

       -loadidx <index file>
              The file from which to  read  the  video  index  data  saved  by
              -saveidx.   This  index will be used for seeking, overriding any
              index data contained in the AVI itself.  MPlayer will  not  pre-
              vent  you  from loading an index file generated from a different
              AVI, but this is sure to cause unfavorable results.
              NOTE: This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML  sup-
              port.

       -mc <seconds/frame>
              maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)

       -mf <option1:option2:...>
              Used when decoding from multiple PNG or JPEG files.

              Available options are:

                 w=<value>
                      input file width (default: autodetect)
                 h=<value>
                      input file height (default: autodetect)
                 fps=<value>
                      output fps (default: 25)
                 type=<value>
                      input file type (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi)

       -ni (AVI only)
              Force  usage  of  non-interleaved  AVI parser (fixes playback of
              some bad AVI files).

       -nobps (AVI only)
              Do not use average byte/second value for A-V sync.   Helps  with
              some AVI files with broken header.

       -noextbased
              Disables  extension-based  demuxer  selection.  By default, when
              the file type (demuxer) cannot be detected  reliably  (the  file
              has no header or it is not reliable enough), the filename exten-
              sion is used to select the demuxer.  Always falls back  on  con-
              tent-based demuxer selection.

       -passwd <password> (also see -user) (network only)
              Specify password for HTTP authentication.

       -prefer-ipv4 (network only)
              Use  IPv4  on network connections.  Falls back on IPv6 automati-
              cally.

       -prefer-ipv6 (IPv6 network only)
              Use IPv6 on network connections.  Falls back on  IPv4  automati-
              cally.

       -psprobe <byte position>
              When  playing  an  MPEG-PS or MPEG-PES streams, this option lets
              you specify how many bytes in the stream  you  want  MPlayer  to
              scan  in order to identify the video codec used.  This option is
              needed to play EVO or VDR files containing H.264 streams.

       -pvr <option1:option2:...> (PVR only)
              This option tunes various encoding properties of the PVR capture
              module.   It has to be used with any hardware MPEG encoder based
              card  supported  by  the  V4L2  driver.   The  Hauppauge   WinTV
              PVR-150/250/350/500  and  all  IVTV based cards are known as PVR
              capture cards.  Be aware that only Linux 2.6.18 kernel and above
              is  able to handle MPEG stream through V4L2 layer.  For hardware
              capture of an MPEG stream and watching it with MPlayer/MEncoder,
              use 'pvr://' as a movie URL.

              Available options are:

                 aspect=<0-3>
                      Specify input aspect ratio:

                         2: 16:9
                         3: 2.21:1

                 arate=<32000-48000>
                      Specify  encoding  audio rate (default: 48000 Hz, avail-
                      able: 32000, 44100 and 48000 Hz).

                 alayer=<1-3>
                      Specify MPEG audio layer encoding (default: 2).

                 abitrate=<32-448>
                      Specify audio encoding bitrate in kbps (default: 384).

                 amode=<value>
                      Specify audio encoding mode.   Available  preset  values
                      are  'stereo',  'joint_stereo',  'dual'  and 'mono' (de-
                      fault: stereo).

                 vbitrate=<value>
                      Specify average video bitrate encoding in Mbps (default:
                      6).

                 vmode=<value>
                      Specify video encoding mode:
                         vbr: Variable BitRate (default)
                         cbr: Constant BitRate

                 vpeak=<value>
                      Specify peak video bitrate encoding in Mbps (only useful
                      for VBR encoding, default: 9.6).

                 fmt=<value>
                      Choose an MPEG format for encoding:
                         ps:    MPEG-2 Program Stream (default)
                         ts:    MPEG-2 Transport Stream
                         mpeg1: MPEG-1 System Stream
                         vcd:   Video CD compatible stream
                         svcd:  Super Video CD compatible stream
                         dvd:   DVD compatible stream

       -radio <option1:option2:...> (radio only)
              These options set various parameters of the radio  capture  mod-
              ule.  For listening to radio with MPlayer use 'radio://<frequen-
              cy>' (if channels option is not given) or 'radio://<channel_num-
              ber>' (if channels option is given) as a movie URL.  You can see
              allowed frequency range by running MPlayer with '-v'.  To  start
              the grabbing subsystem, use 'radio://<frequency or channel>/cap-
              ture'.  If the capture keyword is not given you  can  listen  to
              radio  using the line-in cable only.  Using capture to listen is
              not recommended due to  synchronization  problems,  which  makes
              this process uncomfortable.

              Available options are:

                 device=<value>
                      Radio  device to use (default: /dev/radio0 for Linux and
                      /dev/tuner0 for *BSD).

                 driver=<value>
                      Radio driver to use (default: v4l2 if available,  other-
                      wise v4l).  Currently, v4l and v4l2 drivers are support-
                      ed.

                 volume=<0..100>
                      sound volume for radio device (default 100)

                 freq_min=<value> (*BSD BT848 only)
                      minimum allowed frequency (default: 87.50)

                 freq_max=<value> (*BSD BT848 only)
                      maximum allowed frequency (default: 108.00)

                 channels=<frequency>-<name>,<frequency>-<name>,...
                      Set channel list.  Use _ for spaces in  names  (or  play
                      with  quoting ;-).  The channel names will then be writ-
                      ten using OSD and the slave commands  radio_step_channel
                      and  radio_set_channel  will be usable for a remote con-
                      trol (see LIRC).  If given, number in movie URL will  be
                      treated as channel position in channel list.
                      EXAMPLE: radio://1, radio://104.4, radio_set_channel 1

                 adevice=<value> (radio capture only)
                      Name  of  device  to capture sound from.  Without such a
                      name capture will be disabled, even if the capture  key-
                      word appears in the URL.  For ALSA devices use it in the
                      form hw=<card>.<device>.  If the device name contains  a
                      '=', the module will use ALSA to capture, otherwise OSS.

                 arate=<value> (radio capture only)
                      Rate in samples per second (default: 44100).
                      NOTE:  When  using  audio  capture  set  also  -rawaudio
                      rate=<value>  option  with  the same value as arate.  If
                      you have problems with sound speed (runs  too  quickly),
                      try   to   play   with   different   rate  values  (e.g.
                      48000,44100,32000,...).

                 achannels=<value> (radio capture only)
                      Number of audio channels to capture.

       -rawaudio <option1:option2:...>
              This option lets you play raw audio files.  You have to use -de-
              muxer  rawaudio  as well.  It may also be used to play audio CDs
              which are not 44kHz 16-bit stereo.  For playing raw AC-3 streams
              use -rawaudio format=0x2000 -demuxer rawaudio.

              Available options are:

                 channels=<value>
                      number of channels
                 rate=<value>
                      rate in samples per second
                 samplesize=<value>
                      sample size in bytes
                 bitrate=<value>
                      bitrate for rawaudio files
                 format=<value>
                      fourcc in hex

       -rawvideo <option1:option2:...>
              This option lets you play raw video files.  You have to use -de-
              muxer rawvideo as well.

              Available options are:

                 fps=<value>
                      rate in frames per second (default: 25.0)
                 sqcif|qcif|cif|4cif|pal|ntsc
                      set standard image size
                 w=<value>
                      image width in pixels
                 h=<value>
                      image height in pixels
                 i420|yv12|yuy2|y8
                      set colorspace
                 format=<value>
                      colorspace (fourcc) in  hex  or  string  constant.   Use
                      -rawvideo format=help for a list of possible strings.
                 size=<value>
                      frame size in Bytes

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer foreman.qcif -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo qcif
                      Play the famous "foreman" sample video.
                 mplayer   sample-720x576.yuv   -demuxer   rawvideo  -rawvideo
                 w=720:h=576
                      Play a raw YUV sample.

       -rtsp-port
              Used  with  'rtsp://'  URLs  to  force the client's port number.
              This option may be useful if you are behind a router and want to
              forward the RTSP stream from the server to a specific client.

       -rtsp-destination
              Used  with 'rtsp://' URLs to force the destination IP address to
              be bound.  This option may be useful with some RTSP server which
              do  not send RTP packets to the right interface.  If the connec-
              tion to the RTSP server fails, use -v to see  which  IP  address
              MPlayer  tries to bind to and try to force it to one assigned to
              your computer instead.

       -rtsp-stream-over-tcp (LIVE555 and NEMESI only)
              Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to specify that the resulting  incoming
              RTP  and  RTCP  packets be streamed over TCP (using the same TCP
              connection as RTSP).  This option may be useful if  you  have  a
              broken internet connection that does not pass incoming UDP pack-
              ets (see http://www.live555.com/mplayer/).

       -saveidx <filename>
              Force index rebuilding and dump the index to  <filename>.   Cur-
              rently this only works with AVI files.
              NOTE:  This option is obsolete now that MPlayer has OpenDML sup-
              port.

       -sb <byte position> (also see -ss)
              Seek to byte position.  Useful for playback from  CD-ROM  images
              or VOB files with junk at the beginning.

       -speed <0.01-100>
              Slow down or speed up playback by the factor given as parameter.
              Not guaranteed to work correctly with -oac copy.

       -srate <Hz>
              Select the output sample rate to be used (of course sound  cards
              have  limits on this).  If the sample frequency selected is dif-
              ferent from that of the current media, the resample  or  lavcre-
              sample audio filter will be inserted into the audio filter layer
              to compensate for the difference.  The type of resampling can be
              controlled  by  the  -af-adv option.  The default is fast resam-
              pling that may cause distortion.

       -ss <time> (also see -sb)
              Seek to given time position.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ss 56
                      Seeks to 56 seconds.
                 -ss 01:10:00
                      Seeks to 1 hour 10 min.

       -tskeepbroken
              Tells MPlayer not to discard TS packets reported  as  broken  in
              the stream.  Sometimes needed to play corrupted MPEG-TS files.

       -tsprobe <byte position>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, this option lets you specify how
              many bytes in the stream you want MPlayer to search for the  de-
              sired audio and video IDs.

       -tsprog <1-65534>
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, you can specify with this option
              which program (if present) you want to play.  Can be  used  with
              -vid and -aid.

       -tv <option1:option2:...> (TV/PVR only)
              This  option  tunes various properties of the TV capture module.
              For watching TV with MPlayer, use 'tv://' or 'tv://<channel_num-
              ber>'  or  even  'tv://<channel_name>  (see  option channels for
              channel_name  below)  as  a  movie  URL.   You  can   also   use
              'tv:///<input_id>' to start watching a movie from a composite or
              S-Video input (see option input for details).

              Available options are:

                 noaudio
                      no sound

                 automute=<0-255> (v4l and v4l2 only)
                      If signal strength reported by device is less than  this
                      value, audio and video will be muted.  In most cases au-
                      tomute=100 will be enough.  Default is 0 (automute  dis-
                      abled).

                 driver=<value>
                      See  -tv  driver=help for a list of compiled-in TV input
                      drivers.  available: dummy,  v4l,  v4l2,  bsdbt848  (de-
                      fault: autodetect)

                 device=<value>
                      Specify TV device (default: /dev/video0).  NOTE: For the
                      bsdbt848 driver you can provide both bktr and tuner  de-
                      vice names separating them with a comma, tuner after bk-
                      tr (e.g. -tv device=/dev/bktr1,/dev/tuner1).

                 input=<value>
                      Specify input (default: 0 (TV), see console  output  for
                      available inputs).

                 freq=<value>
                      Specify   the  frequency  to  set  the  tuner  to  (e.g.
                      511.250).  Not compatible with the channels parameter.

                 outfmt=<value>
                      Specify the output format of the  tuner  with  a  preset
                      value  supported  by the V4L driver (yv12, rgb32, rgb24,
                      rgb16, rgb15, uyvy, yuy2, i420) or an  arbitrary  format
                      given  as  hex value.  Try outfmt=help for a list of all
                      available formats.

                 width=<value>
                      output window width

                 height=<value>
                      output window height

                 fps=<value>
                      framerate at which to capture video (frames per second)

                 buffersize=<value>
                      maximum size of the capture  buffer  in  megabytes  (de-
                      fault: dynamical)

                 norm=<value>
                      For  bsdbt848  and  v4l, PAL, SECAM, NTSC are available.
                      For v4l2, see the console  output  for  a  list  of  all
                      available norms, also see the normid option below.

                 normid=<value> (v4l2 only)
                      Sets  the  TV norm to the given numeric ID.  The TV norm
                      depends on the capture card.  See the console output for
                      a list of available TV norms.

                 channel=<value>
                      Set tuner to <value> channel.

                 chanlist=<value>
                      available: europe-east, europe-west, us-bcast, us-cable,
                      etc

                 channels=<chan>-<name>[=<norm>],<chan>-<name>[=<norm>],...
                      Set names for channels.  NOTE: If <chan> is  an  integer
                      greater  than  1000, it will be treated as frequency (in
                      kHz) rather than channel name from frequency table.
                      Use _ for spaces in names (or  play  with  quoting  ;-).
                      The  channel  names  will then be written using OSD, and
                      the slave commands tv_step_channel,  tv_set_channel  and
                      tv_last_channel will be usable for a remote control (see
                      LIRC).  Not compatible with the frequency parameter.
                      NOTE: The channel number will then be  the  position  in
                      the 'channels' list, beginning with 1.
                      EXAMPLE:    tv://1,    tv://TV1,    tv_set_channel    1,
                      tv_set_channel TV1

                 [brightness|contrast|hue|saturation]=<-100-100>
                      Set the image equalizer on the card.

                 audiorate=<value>
                      Set audio capture bitrate.

                 forceaudio
                      Capture audio even if there are no audio sources report-
                      ed by v4l.

                 alsa
                      Capture from ALSA.

                 amode=<0-3>
                      Choose an audio mode:
                         0: mono
                         1: stereo
                         2: language 1
                         3: language 2

                 forcechan=<1-2>
                      By  default, the count of recorded audio channels is de-
                      termined automatically by querying the audio  mode  from
                      the  TV  card.   This  option allows forcing stereo/mono
                      recording regardless of the amode option and the  values
                      returned  by  v4l.  This can be used for troubleshooting
                      when the TV card is unable to report the  current  audio
                      mode.

                 adevice=<value>
                      Set an audio device.  <value> should be /dev/xxx for OSS
                      and a hardware ID for ALSA.  You must replace any ':' by
                      a '.' in the hardware ID for ALSA.

                 audioid=<value>
                      Choose  an  audio  output of the capture card, if it has
                      more than one.

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=<0-65535> (v4l1)

                 [volume|bass|treble|balance]=<0-100> (v4l2)
                      These options set parameters of the mixer on  the  video
                      capture  card.   They  will have no effect, if your card
                      does not have one.  For v4l2 50 maps to the default val-
                      ue of the control, as reported by the driver.

                 gain=<0-100> (v4l2)
                      Set  gain control for video devices (usually webcams) to
                      the desired value and switch off automatic  control.   A
                      value of 0 enables automatic control.  If this option is
                      omitted, gain control will not be modified.

                 immediatemode=<bool>
                      A value of 0 means capture and buffer  audio  and  video
                      together  (default for MEncoder).  A value of 1 (default
                      for MPlayer) means to do video capture only and let  the
                      audio  go  through  a loopback cable from the TV card to
                      the sound card.

                 mjpeg
                      Use hardware MJPEG compression  (if  the  card  supports
                      it).  When using this option, you do not need to specify
                      the width and  height  of  the  output  window,  because
                      MPlayer will determine it automatically from the decima-
                      tion value (see below).

                 decimation=<1|2|4>
                      choose the size of the picture that will  be  compressed
                      by hardware MJPEG compression:
                         1: full size
                             704x576    PAL
                             704x480    NTSC
                         2: medium size
                             352x288    PAL
                             352x240    NTSC
                         4: small size
                             176x144    PAL
                             176x120    NTSC

                 quality=<0-100>
                      Choose  the quality of the JPEG compression (< 60 recom-
                      mended for full size).

                 tdevice=<value>
                      Specify TV teletext  device  (example:  /dev/vbi0)  (de-
                      fault: none).

                 tformat=<format>
                      Specify TV teletext display format (default: 0):
                         0: opaque
                         1: transparent
                         2: opaque with inverted colors
                         3: transparent with inverted colors

                 tpage=<100-899>
                      Specify  initial TV teletext page number (default: 100).

                 tlang=<-1-127>
                      Specify default teletext  language  code  (default:  0),
                      which  will  be used as primary language until a type 28
                      packet is received.  Useful when the teletext system us-
                      es a non-latin character set, but language codes are not
                      transmitted via teletext type 28 packets for  some  rea-
                      son.  To see a list of supported language codes set this
                      option to -1.

                 hidden_video_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate stream with video  renderer  instead  of  Null
                      renderer (default: off).  Will help if video freezes but
                      audio does not.  NOTE: May not work with -vo directx and
                      -vf crop combination.

                 hidden_vp_renderer (dshow only)
                      Terminate  VideoPort  pin stream with video renderer in-
                      stead of removing it  from  the  graph  (default:  off).
                      Useful  if  your  card  has a VideoPort pin and video is
                      choppy.  NOTE: May not work with  -vo  directx  and  -vf
                      crop combination.

                 system_clock (dshow only)
                      Use  the  system clock as sync source instead of the de-
                      fault graph clock (usually the clock  from  one  of  the
                      live sources in graph).

                 normalize_audio_chunks (dshow only)
                      Create  audio  chunks  with a time length equal to video
                      frame time length (default: off).  Some audio cards cre-
                      ate audio chunks about 0.5s in size, resulting in choppy
                      video when using immediatemode=0.

       -tvscan <option1:option2:...> (TV and MPlayer only)
              Tune the TV channel scanner.  MPlayer will also print value  for
              "-tv  channels=" option, including existing and just found chan-
              nels.

              Available suboptions are:

                 autostart
                      Begin channel scanning immediately  after  startup  (de-
                      fault: disabled).

                 period=<0.1-2.0>
                      Specify  delay in seconds before switching to next chan-
                      nel (default: 0.5).   Lower  values  will  cause  faster
                      scanning, but can detect inactive TV channels as active.

                 threshold=<1-100>
                      Threshold value for the signal strength (in percent), as
                      reported by the device (default: 50).  A signal strength
                      higher than this value will indicate that the  currently
                      scanning channel is active.

       -user <username> (also see -passwd) (network only)
              Specify username for HTTP authentication.

       -user-agent <string>
              Use <string> as user agent for HTTP streaming.

       -vid <ID>
              Select  video channel (MPG: 0-15, ASF: 0-255, MPEG-TS: 17-8190).
              When playing an MPEG-TS stream, MPlayer/MEncoder  will  use  the
              first program (if present) with the chosen video stream.

       -vivo <suboption> (DEBUG CODE)
              Force  audio parameters for the VIVO demuxer (for debugging pur-
              poses).  FIXME: Document this.

OSD/SUBTITLE OPTIONS
       NOTE: Also see -vf expand.

       -ass (FreeType only)
              Turn on SSA/ASS subtitle rendering.  With  this  option,  libass
              will be used for SSA/ASS external subtitles and Matroska tracks.
              You may also want to use -embeddedfonts.
              NOTE: Unlike normal OSD, libass uses fontconfig by  default.  To
              disable it, use -nofontconfig.

       -ass-border-color <value>
              Sets  the  border (outline) color for text subtitles.  The color
              format is RRGGBBAA.

       -ass-bottom-margin <value>
              Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame.  The SSA/ASS  ren-
              derer can place subtitles there (with -ass-use-margins).

       -ass-color <value>
              Sets  the  color for text subtitles.  The color format is RRGGB-
              BAA.

       -ass-font-scale <value>
              Set the scale coefficient to be used for fonts  in  the  SSA/ASS
              renderer.

       -ass-force-style <[Style.]Param=Value[,...]>
              Override some style or script info parameters.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ass-force-style FontName=Arial,Default.Bold=1
                 -ass-force-style PlayResY=768

       -ass-hinting <type>
              Set hinting type.  <type> can be:
                 0    no hinting
                 1    FreeType autohinter, light mode
                 2    FreeType autohinter, normal mode
                 3    font native hinter
                 0-3 + 4
                      The  same, but hinting will only be performed if the OSD
                      is rendered at screen resolution and will therefore  not
                      be scaled.
                 The  default  value  is 7 (use native hinter for unscaled OSD
                 and no hinting otherwise).

       -ass-line-spacing <value>
              Set line spacing value for SSA/ASS renderer.

       -ass-styles <filename>
              Load all SSA/ASS styles found in the specified file and use them
              for rendering text subtitles.  The syntax of the file is exactly
              like the [V4 Styles] / [V4+ Styles] section of SSA/ASS.

       -ass-top-margin <value>
              Adds a black band at the top of the frame.  The SSA/ASS renderer
              can place toptitles there (with -ass-use-margins).

       -ass-use-margins
              Enables  placing  toptitles  and subtitles in black borders when
              they are available.

       -dumpjacosub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the  time-based  JACOsub  subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.js
              file in the current directory.

       -dumpmicrodvdsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the MicroDVD subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.sub file in the
              current directory.

       -dumpmpsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              MPlayer's  subtitle format, MPsub.  Creates a dump.mpsub file in
              the current directory.

       -dumpsami (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the time-based SAMI subtitle format.  Creates a dumpsub.smi file
              in the current directory.

       -dumpsrtsub (MPlayer only)
              Convert the given subtitle (specified with the -sub  option)  to
              the time-based SubViewer (SRT) subtitle format.  Creates a dump-
              sub.srt file in the current directory.
              NOTE: Some broken hardware players choke on SRT  subtitle  files
              with  Unix line endings.  If you are unlucky enough to have such
              a box, pass your subtitle files through unix2dos  or  a  similar
              program  to replace Unix line endings with DOS/Windows line end-
              ings.

       -dumpsub (MPlayer only) (BETA CODE)
              Dumps the subtitle substream from VOB  streams.   Also  see  the
              -dump*sub and -vobsubout* options.

       -embeddedfonts (FreeType only)
              Enables  extraction  of  Matroska  embedded fonts (default: dis-
              abled).  These fonts can be used for SSA/ASS subtitle  rendering
              (-ass  option).   Font files are created in the ~/.mplayer/fonts
              directory.
              NOTE: With FontConfig 2.4.2 or newer, embedded fonts are  opened
              directly from memory, and this option is enabled by default.

       -ffactor <number>
              Resample the font alphamap.  Can be:
                 0    plain white fonts
                 0.75 very narrow black outline (default)
                 1    narrow black outline
                 10   bold black outline

       -flip-hebrew (FriBiDi only)
              Turns on flipping subtitles using FriBiDi.

       -noflip-hebrew-commas
              Change  FriBiDi's  assumptions about the placements of commas in
              subtitles.  Use this if commas in subtitles  are  shown  at  the
              start of a sentence instead of at the end.

       -font  <path  to  font.desc file, path to font (FreeType), font pattern
       (Fontconfig)>
              Search  for  the  OSD/SUB fonts in an alternative directory (de-
              fault for normal fonts: ~/.mplayer/font/font.desc,  default  for
              FreeType fonts: ~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf).
              NOTE: With FreeType, this option determines the path to the text
              font file.  With Fontconfig, this option determines the Fontcon-
              fig font pattern.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -font ~/.mplayer/arial-14/font.desc
                 -font ~/.mplayer/arialuni.ttf
                 -font 'Bitstream Vera Sans'
                 -font 'Bitstream Vera Sans:style=Bold'

       -fontconfig (fontconfig only)
              Enables the usage of fontconfig managed fonts.
              NOTE:  By  default fontconfig is used for libass-rendered subti-
              tles and not used for OSD. With -fontconfig it is used for  both
              libass and OSD, with -nofontconfig it is not used at all.

       -forcedsubsonly
              Display  only  forced  subtitles for the DVD subtitle stream se-
              lected by e.g. -slang.

       -fribidi-charset <charset name> (FriBiDi only)
              Specifies the character set that will be passed to FriBiDi  when
              decoding non-UTF-8 subtitles (default: ISO8859-8).

       -ifo <VOBsub IFO file>
              Indicate  the  file  that will be used to load palette and frame
              size for VOBsub subtitles.

       -noautosub
              Turns off automatic subtitle file loading.

       -osd-duration <time>
              Set the duration of the OSD messages in ms (default: 1000).

       -osdlevel <0-3> (MPlayer only)
              Specifies which mode the OSD should start in.
                 0    subtitles only
                 1    volume + seek (default)
                 2    volume + seek + timer + percentage
                 3    volume + seek + timer + percentage + total time

       -overlapsub
              Allows the next subtitle to be displayed while the  current  one
              is still visible (default is to enable the support only for spe-
              cific formats).

       -sid <ID> (also see -slang, -vobsubid)
              Display the subtitle stream specified by <ID>  (0-31).   MPlayer
              prints the available subtitle IDs when run in verbose (-v) mode.
              If you cannot select one of the subtitles on  a  DVD,  also  try
              -vobsubid.

       -nosub Disables  any otherwise auto-selected subtitles (as e.g. the Ma-
              troska/mkv demuxer supports).

       -slang <language code[,language code,...]> (also see -sid)
              Specify a priority list of subtitle languages to use.  Different
              container formats employ different language codes.  DVDs use ISO
              639-1 two letter language codes, Matroska uses ISO  639-2  three
              letter  language  codes  while  OGM uses a free-form identifier.
              MPlayer prints the available languages when run in verbose  (-v)
              mode.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer dvd://1 -slang hu,en
                      Chooses  the Hungarian subtitle track on a DVD and falls
                      back on English if Hungarian is not available.
                 mplayer -slang jpn example.mkv
                      Plays a Matroska file with Japanese subtitles.

       -spuaa <mode>
              Antialiasing/scaling mode for DVD/VOBsub.  A value of 16 may  be
              added to <mode> in order to force scaling even when original and
              scaled frame size already match.  This can be employed  to  e.g.
              smooth subtitles with gaussian blur.  Available modes are:
                 0    none (fastest, very ugly)
                 1    approximate (broken?)
                 2    full (slow)
                 3    bilinear (default, fast and not too bad)
                 4    uses swscaler gaussian blur (looks very good)

       -spualign <-1-2>
              Specify how SPU (DVD/VOBsub) subtitles should be aligned.
                 -1   original position
                  0   Align at top (original behavior, default).
                  1   Align at center.
                  2   Align at bottom.

       -spugauss <0.0-3.0>
              Variance  parameter  of gaussian used by -spuaa 4.  Higher means
              more blur (default: 1.0).

       -sub <subtitlefile1,subtitlefile2,...>
              Use/display these subtitle files.  Only one  file  can  be  dis-
              played at the same time.

       -sub-bg-alpha <0-255>
              Specify  the  alpha  channel  value  for subtitles and OSD back-
              grounds.  Big values mean more transparency.  0 means completely
              transparent.

       -sub-bg-color <0-255>
              Specify the color value for subtitles and OSD backgrounds.  Cur-
              rently subtitles are grayscale so this value  is  equivalent  to
              the intensity of the color.  255 means white and 0 black.

       -sub-demuxer <[+]name> (-subfile only) (BETA CODE)
              Force  subtitle demuxer type for -subfile.  Use a '+' before the
              name to force it, this will skip some checks!  Give the  demuxer
              name as printed by -sub-demuxer help.  For backward compatibili-
              ty it also accepts the demuxer ID as defined in subreader.h.

       -sub-fuzziness <mode>
              Adjust matching fuzziness when searching for subtitles:
                 0    exact match
                 1    Load all subs containing movie name.
                 2    Load all subs in the current directory.

       -sub-no-text-pp
              Disables any kind of text post processing done after loading the
              subtitles.  Used for debug purposes.

       -subalign <0-2>
              Specify  which  edge  of  the subtitles should be aligned at the
              height given by -subpos.
                 0    Align subtitle top edge (original behavior).
                 1    Align subtitle center.
                 2    Align subtitle bottom edge (default).

       -subcc
              Display DVD Closed Caption (CC) subtitles.  These  are  not  the
              VOB subtitles, these are special ASCII subtitles for the hearing
              impaired encoded in the VOB userdata stream  on  most  region  1
              DVDs.  CC subtitles have not been spotted on DVDs from other re-
              gions so far.

       -subcp <codepage> (iconv only)
              If your system supports iconv(3), you can  use  this  option  to
              specify the subtitle codepage.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -subcp latin2
                 -subcp cp1250

       -subcp enca:<language>:<fallback codepage> (ENCA only)
              You  can  specify your language using a two letter language code
              to make ENCA detect the codepage automatically.  If unsure,  en-
              ter  anything  and  watch  mplayer  -v output for available lan-
              guages.  Fallback codepage specifies the codepage to  use,  when
              autodetection fails.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -subcp enca:cs:latin2
                      Guess  the  encoding,  assuming the subtitles are Czech,
                      fall back on latin 2, if the detection fails.
                 -subcp enca:pl:cp1250
                      Guess the encoding for Polish, fall back on cp1250.

       -subdelay <sec>
              Delays subtitles by <sec> seconds.  Can be negative.

       -subfile <filename> (BETA CODE)
              Currently useless.  Same as -audiofile, but for subtitle streams
              (OggDS?).

       -subfont <path to font (FreeType), font pattern (Fontconfig)> (FreeType
       only)
              Sets  the  subtitle  font (see -font).  If no -subfont is given,
              -font is used.

       -subfont-autoscale <0-3> (FreeType only)
              Sets the autoscale mode.
              NOTE: 0 means that text scale and OSD scale are font heights  in
              points.

              The mode can be:

                 0    no autoscale
                 1    proportional to movie height
                 2    proportional to movie width
                 3    proportional to movie diagonal (default)

       -subfont-blur <0-8> (FreeType only)
              Sets the font blur radius (default: 2).

       -subfont-encoding <value> (FreeType only)
              Sets  the  font encoding.  When set to 'unicode', all the glyphs
              from the font file will be rendered and  unicode  will  be  used
              (default: unicode).

       -subfont-osd-scale <0-100> (FreeType only)
              Sets the autoscale coefficient of the OSD elements (default: 6).

       -subfont-outline <0-8> (FreeType only)
              Sets the font outline thickness (default: 2).

       -subfont-text-scale <0-100> (FreeType only)
              Sets the subtitle text autoscale coefficient  as  percentage  of
              the screen size (default: 5).

       -subfps <rate>
              Specify the framerate of the subtitle file (default: movie fps).
              NOTE: <rate> > movie fps speeds the subtitles up for frame-based
              subtitle files and slows them down for time-based ones.

       -subpos <0-100> (useful with -vf expand)
              Specify  the  position of subtitles on the screen.  The value is
              the vertical position of the subtitle in % of the screen height.

       -subwidth <10-100>
              Specify  the  maximum  width of subtitles on the screen.  Useful
              for TV-out.  The value is the width of the subtitle in % of  the
              screen width.

       -noterm-osd
              Disable the display of OSD messages on the console when no video
              output is available.

       -term-osd-esc <escape sequence>
              Specify the escape sequence to use before writing an OSD message
              on  the console.  The escape sequence should move the pointer to
              the beginning of the line used for the OSD  and  clear  it  (de-
              fault: ^[[A\r^[[K).

       -unicode
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as unicode.

       -unrarexec <path to unrar executable> (not supported on MingW)
              Specify  the  path to the unrar executable so MPlayer can use it
              to access rar-compressed VOBsub files (default: not set, so  the
              feature  is  off).  The path must include the executable's file-
              name, i.e. /usr/local/bin/unrar.

       -utf8
              Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as UTF-8.

       -vobsub <VOBsub file without extension>
              Specify a VOBsub file to use for subtitles.  Has to be the  full
              pathname  without  extension, i.e. without the '.idx', '.ifo' or
              '.sub'.

       -vobsubid <0-31>
              Specify the VOBsub subtitle ID.

AUDIO OUTPUT OPTIONS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       -abs <value> (-ao oss only) (OBSOLETE)
              Override audio driver/card buffer size detection.

       -format <format> (also see the format audio filter)
              Select the sample format used for output from the  audio  filter
              layer to the sound card.  The values that <format> can adopt are
              listed below in the description of the format audio filter.

       -mixer <device>
              Use a mixer device different from the default  /dev/mixer.   For
              ALSA this is the mixer name.

       -mixer-channel <mixer line>[,mixer index] (-ao oss and -ao alsa only)
              This  option  will  tell  MPlayer to use a different channel for
              controlling volume than the default PCM.  Options  for  OSS  in-
              clude  vol,  pcm, line.  For a complete list of options look for
              SOUND_DEVICE_NAMES in /usr/include/linux/soundcard.h.  For  ALSA
              you  can  use  the  names  e.g. alsamixer displays, like Master,
              Line, PCM.
              NOTE: ALSA mixer channel names followed  by  a  number  must  be
              specified  in  the  <name,number> format, i.e. a channel labeled
              'PCM 1' in alsamixer must be converted to PCM,1.

       -softvol
              Force the use of the software mixer, instead of using the  sound
              card mixer.

       -softvol-max <10.0-10000.0>
              Set  the  maximum amplification level in percent (default: 110).
              A value of 200 will allow you to adjust the volume up to a maxi-
              mum of double the current level.  With values below 100 the ini-
              tial volume (which is 100%) will be  above  the  maximum,  which
              e.g. the OSD cannot display correctly.

       -volstep <0-100>
              Set  the  step  size  of  mixer volume changes in percent of the
              whole range (default: 3).

       -volume <-1-100> (also see -af volume)
              Set the startup volume in the mixer, either hardware or software
              (if  used  with -softvol).  A value of -1 (the default) will not
              change the volume.

AUDIO OUTPUT DRIVERS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       Audio output drivers are interfaces to different audio  output  facili-
       ties.  The syntax is:

       -ao <driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If  the  list  has a trailing ',' MPlayer will fall back on drivers not
       contained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omit-
       ted.
       NOTE: See -ao help for a list of compiled-in audio output drivers.

       EXAMPLE:
                 -ao alsa,oss,
                      Try the ALSA driver, then the OSS driver, then others.
                 -ao alsa:noblock:device=hw=0.3
                      Sets  noblock-mode  and  the  device-name as first card,
                      fourth device.

       Available audio output drivers are:

       alsa
              ALSA 0.9/1.x audio output driver
                 noblock
                      Sets noblock-mode.
                 device=<device>
                      Sets the device name.  Replace any ',' with '.' and  any
                      ':'  with '=' in the ALSA device name.  For hwac3 output
                      via S/PDIF, use an "iec958" or  "spdif"  device,  unless
                      you really know how to set it correctly.

       alsa5
              ALSA 0.5 audio output driver

       oss
              OSS audio output driver
                 <dsp-device>
                      Sets the audio output device (default: /dev/dsp).
                 <mixer-device>
                      Sets the audio mixer device (default: /dev/mixer).
                 <mixer-channel>
                      Sets the audio mixer channel (default: pcm).

       sdl (SDL only)
              highly  platform  independent SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) li-
              brary audio output driver
                 <driver>
                      Explicitly choose the SDL audio driver to use  (default:
                      let SDL choose).

       arts
              audio output through the aRts daemon

       esd
              audio output through the ESD daemon
                 <server>
                      Explicitly choose the ESD server to use (default: local-
                      host).

       jack
              audio output through JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit)
                 port=<name>
                      Connects to the ports  with  the  given  name  (default:
                      physical ports).
                 name=<client
                      Client  name  that  is  passed to JACK (default: MPlayer
                      [<PID>]).  Useful if you want to  have  certain  connec-
                      tions established automatically.
                 (no)estimate
                      Estimate  the  audio  delay,  supposed to make the video
                      playback smoother (default: enabled).
                 (no)autostart
                      Automatically start jackd if  necessary  (default:  dis-
                      abled).   Note  that this seems unreliable and will spam
                      stdout with server messages.

                 card=<1-4>
                      DVB card to use if more than one card  is  present.   If
                      not specified MPlayer will search the first usable card.
                 file=<filename>
                      output filename

       null
              Produces no audio output but  maintains  video  playback  speed.

                 (no)waveheader
                      Include  or do not include the wave header (default: in-
                      cluded).  When not included, raw PCM will be  generated.
                 file=<filename>
                      Write the sound to <filename> instead of the default au-
                      diodump.wav.  If nowaveheader is specified, the  default
                      is audiodump.pcm.
                 fast
                      Try  to dump faster than realtime.  Make sure the output
                      does not get truncated (usually  with  "Too  many  video
                      packets  in buffer" message).  It is normal that you get
                      a "Your system is too SLOW to play this!" message.

                      Adjust the overlay size (h,w) and position (x,y) in case
                      it does not match the window perfectly (default: 0).

                 overlay
                      Activate overlay (default).

                 nooverlay

       -fbmode <modename> (-vo fbdev only)
              Change  video  mode  to the one that is labeled as <modename> in
              /etc/fb.modes.
              NOTE: VESA framebuffer does not support mode changing.

       -fbmodeconfig <filename> (-vo fbdev only)
              Override framebuffer mode  configuration  file  (default:  /etc/
              fb.modes).

       -fs (also see -zoom)
              Fullscreen  playback  (centers  movie,  and  paints  black bands
              around it).  Not supported by all video output drivers.

       -fsmode-dontuse <0-31> (OBSOLETE, use the -fs option)
              Try this option if you still experience fullscreen problems.

       -fstype <type1,type2,...> (X11 only)
              Specify a priority list of fullscreen modes to be used.  You can
              negate  the modes by prefixing them with '-'.  If you experience
              problems like the fullscreen window being covered by other  win-
              dows try using a different order.
              NOTE: See -fstype help for a full list of available modes.

              The available types are:

                 above
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_ABOVE hint if available.
                 below
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_BELOW hint if available.
                 fullscreen
                      Use the _NETWM_STATE_FULLSCREEN hint if available.
                 layer
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the default layer.
                 layer=<0...15>
                      Use the _WIN_LAYER hint with the given layer number.
                 netwm
                      Force NETWM style.
                 none
                      Clear the list of modes; you can add modes to enable af-
                      terward.
                 stays_on_top
                      Use _NETWM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP hint if available.

              EXAMPLE:
                 layer,stays_on_top,above,fullscreen
                      Default order, will be used as a fallback  if  incorrect
                      or unsupported modes are specified.
                 -fullscreen
                      Fixes fullscreen switching on OpenBox 1.x.

       -geometry x[%][:y[%]] or [WxH][+x+y]
              Adjust where the output is on the screen initially.  The x and y
              specifications are in pixels measured from the top-left  of  the
              screen  to the top-left of the image being displayed, however if
              a percentage sign is given after the argument it turns the value
              into a percentage of the screen size in that direction.  It also
              supports the standard X11 -geometry option format.  If an exter-
              nal  window is specified using the -wid option, then the x and y
              coordinates are relative to the top-left corner  of  the  window
              rather  than  the  screen.   The coordinates are relative to the
              screen given with -xineramascreen for the video  output  drivers
              that  fully  support  -xineramascreen (direct3d, gl, gl2, vdpau,
              x11, xv, xvmc, corevideo).
              NOTE: This option is only supported by the x11, xmga, xv,  xvmc,
              xvidix, gl, gl2, directx, fbdev, tdfxfb and corevideo video out-
              put drivers.

              EXAMPLE:
                 50:40
                      Places the window at x=50, y=40.
                 50%:50%
                      Places the window in the middle of the screen.
                 100%
                      Places the window at the middle of the right edge of the
                      screen.
                 100%:100%
                      Places  the  window  at  the  bottom right corner of the
                      screen.

       -guiwid <window ID> (also see -wid) (GUI only)
              This tells the GUI to also use an X11 window and stick itself to
              the  bottom of the video, which is useful to embed a mini-GUI in
              a browser (with the MPlayer plugin for instance).

       -hue <-100-100>
              Adjust the hue of the video signal (default: 0).  You can get  a
              colored  negative  of the image with this option.  Not supported
              by all video output drivers.

       -monitor-dotclock <range[,range,...]> (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the dotclock or pixelclock range of the monitor.

       -monitor-hfreq <range[,range,...]> (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the horizontal frequency range of the monitor.

       -monitor-vfreq <range[,range,...]> (-vo fbdev and vesa only)
              Specify the vertical frequency range of the monitor.

       -monitoraspect <ratio> (also see -aspect)
              Set the aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen.  A value of 0
              disables  a  previous  setting (e.g. in the config file).  Over-
              rides the -monitorpixelaspect setting if enabled.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -monitoraspect 4:3  or 1.3333
                 -monitoraspect 16:9 or 1.7777

       -monitorpixelaspect <ratio> (also see -aspect)
              Set the aspect of a single pixel of your monitor  or  TV  screen
              (default:  1).   A  value  of 1 means square pixels (correct for
              (almost?) all LCDs).

       -name (X11 only)
              Set the window class name.

       -nodouble
              Disables double buffering, mostly for debugging purposes.   Dou-
              ble buffering fixes flicker by storing two frames in memory, and
              displaying one while decoding another.  It can affect OSD  nega-
              tively, but often removes OSD flickering.

       -nograbpointer
              Do  not  grab the mouse pointer after a video mode change (-vm).
              Useful for multihead setups.

       -nokeepaspect
              Do not keep window aspect ratio  when  resizing  windows.   Only
              works  with  the  x11,  xv,  xmga,  xvidix, directx video output
              drivers.  Furthermore under X11 your window manager has to honor
              window aspect hints.

       -ontop
              Makes the player window stay on top of other windows.  Supported
              by video output drivers which use X11, except SDL,  as  well  as
              directx, corevideo, quartz, ggi and gl2.

       -panscan <0.0-1.0>
              Enables pan-and-scan functionality (cropping the sides of e.g. a
              16:9 movie to make it fit a 4:3 display  without  black  bands).
              The range controls how much of the image is cropped.  Only works
              with the xv, xmga, mga, gl, gl2, quartz,  corevideo  and  xvidix
              video output drivers.
              NOTE:  Values  between  -1 and 0 are allowed as well, but highly
              experimental and may crash or worse.  Use at your own risk!

       -panscanrange <-19.0-99.0> (experimental)
              Change the range of the pan-and-scan functionality (default: 1).
              Positive  values  mean multiples of the default range.  Negative
              numbers mean you can zoom in up to a factor of  -panscanrange+1.
              E.g.  -panscanrange  -3  allows  a zoom factor of up to 4.  This
              feature is experimental.  Do not report bugs unless you are  us-
              ing -vo gl.

       -refreshrate <Hz>
              Set  the monitor refreshrate in Hz.  Currently only supported by
              -vo directx combined with the -vm option.

       -rootwin
              Play movie in the root  window  (desktop  background).   Desktop
              background  images  may  cover  the  movie window, though.  Only
              works with the x11, xv, xmga, xvidix, quartz, corevideo and  di-
              rectx video output drivers.

       -saturation <-100-100>
              Adjust the saturation of the video signal (default: 0).  You can
              get grayscale output with this option.   Not  supported  by  all
              video output drivers.

       -screenh <pixels>
              Specify  the screen height for video output drivers which do not
              know the screen resolution like fbdev, x11 and TV-out.

       -screenw <pixels>
              Specify the screen width for video output drivers which  do  not
              know the screen resolution like fbdev, x11 and TV-out.

       -stop-xscreensaver (X11 only)
              Turns off xscreensaver at startup and turns it on again on exit.
              If your screensaver supports neither the XSS  nor  XResetScreen-
              Saver API please use -heartbeat-cmd instead.

       -title (also see -use-filename-title)
              Set  the  window  title.   Supported  by  X11-based video output
              drivers.

       -use-filename-title (also see -title)
              Set the window title using the media filename, when not set with
              -title.  Supported by X11-based video output drivers.

       -vm
              Try  to change to a different video mode.  Supported by the dga,
              x11, xv, sdl and directx video output drivers.  If used with the
              directx  video  output  driver  the -screenw, -screenh, -bpp and
              -refreshrate options can be used to set the new display mode.

       -vsync
              Enables VBI for the vesa, dfbmga and svga video output  drivers.

       -wid <window ID> (also see -guiwid) (X11, OpenGL and DirectX only)
              This  tells  MPlayer to attach to an existing window.  Useful to
              embed MPlayer in a browser (e.g. the plugger  extension).   This
              option  fills  the given window completely, thus aspect scaling,
              panscan, etc are no longer handled by MPlayer but must  be  man-
              aged by the application that created the window.

       -xineramascreen <-2-...>
              In  Xinerama  configurations  (i.e.  a single desktop that spans
              across multiple displays) this option tells MPlayer which screen
              to  display the movie on.  A value of -2 means fullscreen across
              the whole virtual display (in this case Xinerama information  is
              completely ignored), -1 means fullscreen on the display the win-
              dow currently is on.  The initial position set via the -geometry
              option  is  relative to the specified screen.  Will usually only
              work with "-fstype -fullscreen" or "-fstype none".  This  option
              is  not suitable to only set the startup screen (because it will
              always display on the given screen in fullscreen mode),  -geome-
              try  is  the  best that is available for that purpose currently.
              Supported by at least the direct3d, gl, gl2, x11, xv and  corev-
              ideo video output drivers.

       -zrbw (-vo zr only)
              Display  in  black and white.  For optimal performance, this can
              be combined with '-lavdopts gray'.

       -zrcrop <[width]x[height]+[x offset]+[y offset]> (-vo zr only)
              Select a part of the input image  to  display,  multiple  occur-
              rences of this option switch on cinerama mode.  In cinerama mode
              the movie is distributed over more than one TV  (or  beamer)  to
              create a larger image.  Options appearing after the n-th -zrcrop
              apply to the n-th MJPEG card, each card should at least  have  a
              -zrdev in addition to the -zrcrop.  For examples, see the output
              of -zrhelp and the Zr section of the documentation.

       -zrdev <device> (-vo zr only)
              Specify the device special file that belongs to your MJPEG card,
              by default the zr video output driver takes the first v4l device
              it can find.

       -zrfd (-vo zr only)
              Force  decimation:  Decimation,  as  specified  by  -zrhdec  and
              -zrvdec, only happens if the hardware scaler can stretch the im-
              age to its original size.  Use this option to force  decimation.

       -zrhdec <1|2|4> (-vo zr only)
              Horizontal  decimation: Ask the driver to send only every 2nd or
              4th line/pixel of the input image to the MJPEG card and use  the
              scaler  of  the  MJPEG card to stretch the image to its original
              size.

       -zrhelp (-vo zr only)
              Display a list of all -zr* options, their default values  and  a
              cinerama mode example.

       -zrnorm <norm> (-vo zr only)
              Specify the TV norm as PAL or NTSC (default: no change).

       -zrquality <1-20> (-vo zr only)
              A  number  from 1 (best) to 20 (worst) representing the JPEG en-
              coding quality.

       -zrvdec <1|2|4> (-vo zr only)
              Vertical decimation: Ask the driver to send only  every  2nd  or
              4th  line/pixel of the input image to the MJPEG card and use the
              scaler of the MJPEG card to stretch the image  to  its  original
              size.

       -zrxdoff <x display offset> (-vo zr only)
              If  the  movie is smaller than the TV screen, this option speci-
              fies the x offset from the upper-left corner of  the  TV  screen
              (default: centered).

       -zrydoff <y display offset> (-vo zr only)
              If  the  movie is smaller than the TV screen, this option speci-
              fies the y offset from the upper-left corner of  the  TV  screen
              (default: centered).

VIDEO OUTPUT DRIVERS (MPLAYER ONLY)
       Video  output  drivers are interfaces to different video output facili-
       ties.  The syntax is:

       -vo <driver1[:suboption1[=value]:...],driver2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ',' MPlayer will fall back  on  drivers  not
       contained in the list.  Suboptions are optional and can mostly be omit-
       ted.
       NOTE: See -vo help for a list of compiled-in video output drivers.

       EXAMPLE:
                 -vo xmga,xv,
                      Try the Matrox X11 driver, then the Xv driver, then oth-
                      ers.
                 -vo directx:noaccel
                      Uses  the  DirectX  driver  with  acceleration  features
                      turned off.

       Available video output drivers are:

       xv (X11 only)
              Uses the XVideo extension of XFree86 4.x to enable hardware  ac-
              celerated playback.  If you cannot use a hardware specific driv-
              er, this is probably the best  option.   For  information  about
              what  colorkey  is  used and how it is drawn run MPlayer with -v
              option and look out for the lines tagged with [xv common] at the
              beginning.
                 adaptor=<number>
                      Select a specific XVideo adaptor (check xvinfo results).
                 port=<number>
                      Select a specific XVideo port.
                 ck=<cur|use|set>
                      Select the source from which the colorkey is taken  (de-
                      fault: cur).
                         cur  The  default takes the colorkey currently set in
                              Xv.
                         use  Use but do not set  the  colorkey  from  MPlayer
                              (use -colorkey option to change it).
                         set  Same as use but also sets the supplied colorkey.
                 ck-method=<man|bg|auto>
                      Sets the colorkey drawing method (default: man).
                         man  Draw the colorkey manually (reduces  flicker  in
                              some cases).
                         bg   Set the colorkey as window background.
                         auto Let Xv draw the colorkey.

       x11 (X11 only)
              Shared  memory video output driver without hardware acceleration
              that works whenever X11 is present.

       xover (X11 only)
              Adds X11 support to all  overlay  based  video  output  drivers.
              Currently only supported by tdfx_vid.
                 <vo_driver>
                      Select  the driver to use as source to overlay on top of
                      X11.

       vdpau (with -vc ffmpeg12vdpau, ffwmv3vdpau, ffvc1vdpau, ffh264vdpau
              or ffodivxvdpau) Video output that uses VDPAU  to  decode  video
              via  hardware.   Also  supports  displaying  of software-decoded
              video.
                 sharpen=<-1-1>
                      For positive values, apply a sharpening algorithm to the
                      video,  for  negative  values  a blurring algorithm (de-
                      fault: 0).
                 denoise=<0-1>
                      Apply a noise reduction algorithm to the video (default:
                      0, no noise reduction).
                 deint=<0-4>
                      Select the deinterlacer (default: 0).  All modes > 0 re-
                      spect -field-dominance.
                         0    no deinterlacing
                         1    Show only first field, similar to -vf field.
                         2    Bob deinterlacing, similar to -vf tfields=1.
                         3    motion adaptive temporal deinterlacing May  lead
                              to  A/V  desync  with slow video hardware and/or
                              high resolution.  This is the default if "D"  is
                              used to enable deinterlacing.
                         4    motion   adaptive  temporal  deinterlacing  with
                              edge-guided  spatial  interpolation  Needs  fast
                              video hardware.
                 chroma-deint
                      Makes  temporal  deinterlacers  operate both on luma and
                      chroma (default).  Use nochroma-deint to solely use luma
                      and  speed  up advanced deinterlacing.  Useful with slow
                      video memory.
                 pullup
                      Try to apply inverse  telecine,  needs  motion  adaptive
                      temporal deinterlacing.
                 colorspace
                      Select  the  color  space for YUV to RGB conversion.  In
                      general BT.601 should be used  for  standard  definition
                      (SD)  content  and  BT.709 for high definition (HD) con-
                      tent.  Using incorrect color space results  in  slightly
                      under or over saturated and shifted colors.
                         0    Guess the color space based on video resolution.
                              Video with width >= 1280 or height > 576 is  as-
                              sumed  to  be  HD and BT.709 color space will be
                              used.
                         1    Use ITU-R BT.601 color space (default).
                         2    Use ITU-R BT.709 color space.
                         3    Use SMPTE-240M color space.
                 hqscaling
                         0    Use default VDPAU scaling (default).
                         1-9  Apply high quality VDPAU scaling (needs  capable
                              hardware).
                 force-mixer
                      Forces  the use of the VDPAU mixer, which implements all
                      above options (default).   Use  noforce-mixer  to  allow
                      displaying BGRA colorspace.  (Disables all above options
                      and the hardware equalizer if image format BGRA is actu-
                      ally used.)

       xvmc (X11 with -vc ffmpeg12mc only)
              Video output driver that uses the XvMC (X Video Motion Compensa-
              tion) extension of XFree86 4.x to speed up MPEG-1/2 and VCR2 de-
              coding.
                 adaptor=<number>
                      Select a specific XVideo adaptor (check xvinfo results).
                 port=<number>
                      Select a specific XVideo port.
                 (no)benchmark
                      Disables image display.  Necessary for proper benchmark-
                      ing  of drivers that change image buffers on monitor re-
                      trace only (nVidia).  Default is not  to  disable  image
                      display (nobenchmark).
                 (no)bobdeint
                      Very  simple  deinterlacer.   Might not look better than
                      -vf tfields=1, but it is the only deinterlacer for  xvmc
                      (default: nobobdeint).
                 (no)queue
                      Queue  frames for display to allow more parallel work of
                      the video hardware.  May add a  small  (not  noticeable)
                      constant A/V desync (default: noqueue).
                 (no)sleep
                      Use sleep function while waiting for rendering to finish
                      (not recommended on Linux) (default: nosleep).
                 ck=cur|use|set
                      Same as -vo xv:ck (see -vo xv).
                 ck-method=man|bg|auto
                      Same as -vo xv:ck-method (see -vo xv).

              Highly  platform  independent SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) li-
              brary video output driver.  Since SDL uses its  own  X11  layer,
              MPlayer X11 options do not have any effect on SDL.  Note that it
              has several minor bugs (-vm/-novm is mostly ignored, -fs behaves
              like  -novm  should, window is in top-left corner when returning
              from fullscreen, panscan is not supported, ...).
                 driver=<driver>
                      Explicitly choose the SDL driver to use.
                 (no)forcexv

                      forcexv).
                 (no)hwaccel
                      Use hardware accelerated scaler (default: hwaccel).

       vidix
              VIDIX  (VIDeo  Interface  for *niX) is an interface to the video
              acceleration features of different graphics  cards.   Very  fast

                      same as vidix

       winvidix (Windows only)
              Windows frontend for VIDIX
                 <subdevice>
                      same as vidix

       direct3d (Windows only) (BETA CODE!)
              Video output driver that uses the Direct3D interface (useful for
              Vista).

                      disabled).  Try to enable this option if your video card
                      supports upscaling only.

       quartz (Mac OS X only)
              Mac  OS X Quartz video output driver.  Under some circumstances,
              it might be more efficient to force a packed YUV output  format,
              with e.g. -vf format=yuy2.
                 device_id=<number>
                      Choose the display device to use in fullscreen.
                 fs_res=<width>:<height>
                      Specify  the  fullscreen resolution (useful on slow sys-
                      tems).

              Mac OS X CoreVideo video output driver
                 device_id=<number>
                      Choose the display device to use for fullscreen  or  set
                      it  to -1 to always use the same screen the video window
                      is on (default: -1 - auto).
                 shared_buffer
                      Write output to a shared memory buffer instead  of  dis-
                      playing  it and try to open an existing NSConnection for
                      communication with a GUI.
                 buffer_name=<name>
                      Name of the shared buffer created with shm_open as  well
                      as the name of the NSConnection MPlayer will try to open
                      (default: "mplayerosx").  Setting buffer_name implicitly
                      enables shared_buffer.

       fbdev (Linux only)
              Uses the kernel framebuffer to play video.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly  choose  the  fbdev  device name to use (e.g.
                      /dev/fb0) or the name of the VIDIX subdevice if the  de-
                      vice  name  starts with 'vidix' (e.g. 'vidixsis_vid' for
                      the sis driver).

       fbdev2 (Linux only)
              Uses the kernel framebuffer to play video, alternative implemen-
              tation.
                 <device>
                      Explicitly choose the fbdev device name to use (default:
                      /dev/fb0).

       vesa
              Very general video output driver that should work  on  any  VESA

                      Activate the Linux Video Overlay on top of VESA mode.

       svga
              Play video using the SVGA library.
                 <video mode>
                      Specify  video  mode to use.  The mode can be given in a
                      <width>x<height>x<colors> format, e.g. 640x480x16M or be
                      a graphics mode number, e.g. 84.
                 bbosd
                      Draw OSD into black bands below the movie (slower).
                 native
                      Use  only  native drawing functions.  This avoids direct
                      rendering, OSD and hardware acceleration.
                 retrace
                      Force frame switch on  vertical  retrace.   Usable  only
                      with  -double.  It has the same effect as the -vsync op-
                      tion.
                 sq
                      Try to select a video mode with square pixels.
                 vidix
                      Use svga with VIDIX.

       gl
              OpenGL video output driver, simple version.  Video size must  be
              smaller than the maximum texture size of your OpenGL implementa-
              tion.  Intended to work even with the most basic  OpenGL  imple-
              mentations,  but also makes use of newer extensions, which allow
              support for more colorspaces and direct rendering.  For  optimal
              speed try something similar to
              -vo gl:yuv=2:rectangle=2:force-pbo:ati-hack -dr -noslices
              The  code  performs  very  few  checks, so if a feature does not
              work, this  might  be  because  it  is  not  supported  by  your
              card/OpenGL implementation even if you do not get any error mes-
              sage.  Use glxinfo or a similar tool to  display  the  supported
              OpenGL extensions.
                 (no)ati-hack
                      ATI  drivers  may  give  a corrupted image when PBOs are
                      used (when using -dr or force-pbo).  This  option  fixes
                      this, at the expense of using a bit more memory.
                 (no)force-pbo
                      Always  uses  PBOs to transfer textures even if this in-
                      volves an extra copy.  Currently this gives a little ex-
                      tra  speed with NVidia drivers and a lot more speed with
                      ATI drivers.  May need -noslices and the ati-hack subop-
                      tion to work correctly.
                 (no)scaled-osd
                      Changes  the  way  the  OSD behaves when the size of the
                      window changes (default: disabled).   When  enabled  be-
                      haves more like the other video output drivers, which is
                      better for fixed-size fonts.  Disabled looks much better
                      with  FreeType  fonts and uses the borders in fullscreen
                      mode.  Does not work correctly with ass  subtitles  (see
                      -ass),  you  can instead render them without OpenGL sup-
                      port via -vf ass.
                 osdcolor=<0xAARRGGBB>
                      Color for OSD (default: 0x00ffffff, corresponds to  non-
                      transparent white).
                 rectangle=<0,1,2>
                      Select  usage  of rectangular textures which saves video
                      RAM, but often is slower (default: 0).
                         0: Use power-of-two textures (default).
                         1: Use the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension.
                         2: Use the GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two extension.
                         In  some  cases  only  supported in software and thus
                         very slow.
                 swapinterval=<n>
                      Minimum interval between two buffer  swaps,  counted  in
                      displayed  frames  (default: 1).  1 is equivalent to en-
                      abling VSYNC, 0 to disabling VSYNC.  Values below 0 will
                      leave it at the system default.  This limits the framer-
                      ate  to  (horizontal  refresh  rate  /   n).    Requires
                      GLX_SGI_swap_control   support   to   work.   With  some
                      (most/all?)   implementations   this   only   works   in
                      fullscreen mode.
                 ycbcr
                      Use  the  GL_MESA_ycbcr_texture extension to convert YUV
                      to RGB.  In most cases this is probably slower than  do-
                      ing software conversion to RGB.
                 yuv=<n>
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB conversion.
                         0:  Use  software  conversion  (default).  Compatible
                         with all OpenGL versions.  Provides brightness,  con-
                         trast and saturation control.
                         1:  Use register combiners.  This uses an nVidia-spe-
                         cific extension (GL_NV_register_combiners).  At least
                         three  texture units are needed.  Provides saturation
                         and hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         2: Use a fragment program.   Needs  the  GL_ARB_frag-
                         ment_program  extension  and  at  least three texture
                         units.  Provides brightness, contrast, saturation and
                         hue control.
                         3:  Use a fragment program using the POW instruction.
                         Needs the GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension  and  at
                         least three texture units.  Provides brightness, con-
                         trast, saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma  can
                         also  be  set  independently for red, green and blue.
                         Method 4 is usually faster.
                         4: Use a fragment  program  with  additional  lookup.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension and at
                         least four texture units.  Provides brightness,  con-
                         trast,  saturation, hue and gamma control.  Gamma can
                         also be set independently for red, green and blue.
                         5: Use ATI-specific method (for older  cards).   This
                         uses an ATI-specific extension (GL_ATI_fragment_shad-
                         er - not GL_ARB_fragment_shader!).   At  least  three
                         texture  units  are  needed.  Provides saturation and
                         hue control.  This method is fast but inexact.
                         6: Use a 3D texture  to  do  conversion  via  lookup.
                         Needs  the  GL_ARB_fragment_program  extension and at
                         least four texture units.  Extremely  slow  (software
                         emulation)  on  some (all?) ATI cards since it uses a
                         texture with  border  pixels.   Provides  brightness,
                         contrast,  saturation,  hue and gamma control.  Gamma
                         can also be set  independently  for  red,  green  and
                         blue.   Speed  depends  more  on GPU memory bandwidth
                         than other methods.
                 colorspace
                      Select the color space for YUV to RGB conversion.
                         0    Use the formula used normally  by  MPlayer  (de-
                              fault).
                         1    Use ITU-R BT.601 color space.
                         2    Use ITU-R BT.709 color space.
                         3    Use SMPTE-240M color space.
                 levelconv=<n>
                      Select  the  brightness  level conversion to use for the
                      YUV to RGB conversion
                         0    Convert TV to PC levels (default).
                         1    Convert PC to TV levels.
                         2    Do not do any conversion.
                 lscale=<n>
                      Select the scaling function to use for  luminance  scal-
                      ing.  Only valid for yuv modes 2, 3, 4 and 6.
                         0: Use simple linear filtering (default).
                         1:  Use  bicubic B-spline filtering (better quality).
                         Needs one additional texture unit.  Older cards  will
                         not  be  able  to  handle this for chroma at least in
                         fullscreen mode.
                         2: Use cubic filtering in horizontal, linear  filter-
                         ing in vertical direction.  Works on a few more cards
                         than method 1.
                         3: Same as 1 but  does  not  use  a  lookup  texture.
                         Might be faster on some cards.
                         4:  Use experimental unsharp masking with 3x3 support
                         and a default strength of 0.5 (see  filter-strength).
                         5:  Use experimental unsharp masking with 5x5 support
                         and a default strength of 0.5 (see  filter-strength).
                 cscale=<n>
                      Select the scaling function to use for chrominance scal-
                      ing.  For details see lscale.
                 filter-strength=<value>
                      Set the effect strength for  the  lscale/cscale  filters
                      that support it.
                 customprog=<filename>
                      Load  a  custom  fragment  program from <filename>.  See
                      TOOLS/edgedect.fp for an example.
                 customtex=<filename>
                      Load a custom  "gamma  ramp"  texture  from  <filename>.
                      This  can  be used in combination with yuv=4 or with the
                      customprog option.
                 (no)customtlin
                      If enabled (default) use GL_LINEAR interpolation, other-
                      wise use GL_NEAREST for customtex texture.
                 (no)customtrect
                      If enabled, use texture_rectangle for customtex texture.
                      Default is disabled.
                 (no)mipmapgen
                      If enabled, mipmaps for the video are automatically gen-
                      erated.  This should be useful together with the custom-
                      prog and the TXB instruction to implement  blur  filters
                      with  a  large  radius.  For most OpenGL implementations
                      this is very slow for any non-RGB formats.   Default  is
                      disabled.

              Normally  there  is no reason to use the following options, they
              mostly exist for testing purposes.

                 (no)glfinish
                      Call glFinish() before swapping buffers.  Slower but  in
                      some cases more correct output (default: disabled).
                 (no)manyfmts
                      Enables  support  for  more  (RGB and BGR) color formats
                      (default: enabled).  Needs OpenGL version >= 1.2.
                 slice-height=<0-...>
                      Number of lines copied to texture in one piece (default:
                      0).  0 for whole image.
                      NOTE:  If  YUV  colorspace  is used (see yuv suboption),
                      special rules apply:
                         If the decoder uses slice rendering (see  -noslices),
                         this setting has no effect, the size of the slices as
                         provided by the decoder is used.
                         If the decoder does not use slice rendering, the  de-
                         fault is 16.
                 (no)osd
                      Enable  or  disable support for OSD rendering via OpenGL
                      (default: enabled).  This option is for testing; to dis-
                      able the OSD use -osdlevel 0 instead.
                 (no)aspect
                      Enable  or  disable aspect scaling and pan-and-scan sup-
                      port  (default:  enabled).   Disabling  might   increase
                      speed.

       gl2
              Variant  of  the  OpenGL  video  output driver.  Supports videos
              larger than the maximum texture size but lacks many of  the  ad-
              vanced  features  and  optimizations of the gl driver and is un-
              likely to be extended further.
                 (no)glfinish
                      same as gl (default: enabled)
                 yuv=<n>
                      Select the type of YUV to RGB  conversion.   If  set  to
                      anything  except  0 OSD will be disabled and brightness,
                      contrast and gamma setting is  only  available  via  the
                      global  X  server  settings.  Apart from this the values
                      have the same meaning as for -vo gl.

       matrixview
              OpenGL-based renderer creating a  Matrix-like  running-text  ef-
              fect.
                 cols=<n>
                      Number  of  text columns to display.  Very low values (<
                      16) will probably fail due to scaler limitations.   Val-
                      ues not divisible by 16 may cause issues as well.
                 rows=<n>
                      Number  of text rows to display.  Very low values (< 16)
                      will probably fail due to  scaler  limitations.   Values
                      not divisible by 16 may cause issues as well.

       null
              Produces no video output.  Useful for benchmarking.

       aa
              ASCII art video output driver that works on a text console.  You
              can get a list and an explanation of available suboptions by ex-
              ecuting 'mplayer -vo aa:help'.
              NOTE: The driver does not handle -aspect correctly.
              HINT:  You  probably  have  to specify -monitorpixelaspect.  Try
              'mplayer -vo aa -monitorpixelaspect 0.5'.

       caca
              Color ASCII art video output driver that works on  a  text  con-
              sole.

       bl
              Video playback using the Blinkenlights UDP protocol.  This driv-
              er is highly hardware specific.
                 <subdevice>
                      Explicitly choose the Blinkenlights subdevice driver  to
                      use.  It is something like arcade:host=localhost:2323 or
                      hdl:file=name1,file=name2.  You must  specify  a  subde-
                      vice.

       ggi
              GGI graphics system video output driver
                 <driver>
                      Explicitly  choose  the  GGI driver to use.  Replace any
                      ',' that would appear in the driver string by a '.'.

       directfb
              Play video using the DirectFB library.
                 (no)input
                      Use the DirectFB instead of the  MPlayer  keyboard  code
                      (default: enabled).
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      Double  and  triple  buffering  give best results if you
                      want to avoid tearing issues.  Triple buffering is  more
                      efficient  than  double  buffering  as it does not block
                      MPlayer while waiting for the vertical retrace.   Single
                      buffering should be avoided (default: single).
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      Control the output order for interlaced frames (default:
                      disabled).  Valid values are top  =  top  fields  first,
                      bottom = bottom fields first.  This option does not have
                      any effect on progressive film material like  most  MPEG
                      movies  are.  You need to enable this option if you have
                      tearing issues or unsmooth motions  watching  interlaced
                      film material.
                 layer=N
                      Will  force  layer with ID N for playback (default: -1 -
                      auto).
                 dfbopts=<list>
                      Specify a parameter list for DirectFB.

       dfbmga
              Matrox G400/G450/G550 specific video output driver that uses the
              DirectFB  library to make use of special hardware features.  En-
              ables CRTC2 (second head), displaying video independently of the
              first head.
                 (no)input
                      same as directfb (default: disabled)
                 buffermode=single|double|triple
                      same as directfb (default: triple)
                 fieldparity=top|bottom
                      same as directfb
                 (no)bes
                      Enable  the  use of the Matrox BES (backend scaler) (de-
                      fault: disabled).  Gives very  good  results  concerning
                      speed  and  output  quality as interpolated picture pro-
                      cessing is done in hardware.  Works only on the  primary
                      head.
                 (no)spic
                      Make  use of the Matrox sub picture layer to display the
                      OSD (default: enabled).
                 (no)crtc2
                      Turn on TV-out on the second  head  (default:  enabled).
                      The output quality is amazing as it is a full interlaced
                      picture with proper sync to every odd/even field.
                 tvnorm=pal|ntsc|auto
                      Will set the TV norm of the Matrox card without the need
                      for   modifying   /etc/directfbrc  (default:  disabled).
                      Valid norms are pal = PAL, ntsc = NTSC.  Special norm is
                      auto  (auto-adjust  using  PAL/NTSC)  because it decides
                      which norm to use by looking at  the  framerate  of  the
                      movie.

                      Specifies the device number to use if you have more than
                      one  DVB  output card (V3 API only, such as 1.x.y series
                      drivers).  If not  specified  MPlayer  will  search  the
                      first usable card.
                 <filename>
                      output filename (default: ./grab.mpg)

       zr (also see -zr* and -zrhelp)
              Video  output  driver  for  a  number  of MJPEG capture/playback
              cards.

       zr2 (also see the zrmjpeg video filter)
              Video output driver  for  a  number  of  MJPEG  capture/playback
              cards, second generation.
                 dev=<device>

                 (no)prebuf
                      (De)Activate prebuffering, not yet supported.

       md5sum
              Calculate MD5 sums of each frame and write them to a file.  Sup-
              ports RGB24 and YV12 colorspaces.  Useful for debugging.
                 outfile=<value>
                      Specify the output filename (default: ./md5sums).

       yuv4mpeg
              Transforms the video stream into a sequence of uncompressed  YUV
              4:2:0  images  and  stores it in a file (default: ./stream.yuv).
              The format is the same as the one  employed  by  mjpegtools,  so
              this  is useful if you want to process the video with the mjpeg-
              tools suite.  It supports the YV12, RGB (24  bpp)  and  BGR  (24
              bpp)  format.   You  can combine it with the -fixed-vo option to
              concatenate files with the same dimensions and fps value.
                 interlaced
                      Write the output as interlaced frames, top field  first.
                 interlaced_bf
                      Write  the  output  as  interlaced  frames, bottom field
                      first.
                 file=<filename>
                      Write the output to <filename> instead  of  the  default
                      stream.yuv.

              NOTE: If you do not specify any option the output is progressive
              (i.e. not interlaced).

       gif89a
              Output each frame into a single animated GIF file in the current
              directory.  It supports only RGB format with 24 bpp and the out-
              put is converted to 256 colors.
                 <fps>
                      Float value to specify framerate (default: 5.0).
                 <output>
                      Specify the output filename (default: ./out.gif).

              NOTE: You must specify the framerate before the filename or  the
              framerate will be part of the filename.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer video.nut -vo gif89a:fps=15:output=test.gif

       jpeg
              Output  each  frame  into  a JPEG file in the current directory.
              Each file takes the frame number padded with  leading  zeros  as
              name.
                 [no]progressive
                      Specify  standard  or  progressive JPEG (default: nopro-
                      gressive).
                 [no]baseline
                      Specify use of baseline or not (default: baseline).
                 optimize=<0-100>
                      optimization factor (default: 100)
                 smooth=<0-100>
                      smooth factor (default: 0)
                 quality=<0-100>
                      quality factor (default: 75)
                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify the directory to save the  JPEG  files  to  (de-
                      fault: ./).
                 subdirs=<prefix>
                      Create numbered subdirectories with the specified prefix
                      to save the files in instead of the current directory.
                 maxfiles=<value> (subdirs only)
                      Maximum number of files to be  saved  per  subdirectory.
                      Must be equal to or larger than 1 (default: 1000).

       pnm
              Output  each  frame  into  a  PNM file in the current directory.
              Each file takes the frame number padded with  leading  zeros  as
              name.   It  supports  PPM,  PGM and PGMYUV files in both raw and
              ASCII mode.  Also see pnm(5), ppm(5) and pgm(5).
                 ppm
                      Write PPM files (default).
                 pgm
                      Write PGM files.
                 pgmyuv
                      Write PGMYUV files.  PGMYUV is like  PGM,  but  it  also
                      contains  the  U  and V plane, appended at the bottom of
                      the picture.
                 raw
                      Write PNM files in raw mode (default).
                 ascii
                      Write PNM files in ASCII mode.
                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify the directory to save the PNM files to (default:
                      ./).
                 subdirs=<prefix>
                      Create numbered subdirectories with the specified prefix
                      to save the files in instead of the current directory.
                 maxfiles=<value> (subdirs only)
                      Maximum number of files to be  saved  per  subdirectory.
                      Must be equal to or larger than 1 (default: 1000).

       png
              Output  each  frame  into  a  PNG file in the current directory.
              Each file takes the frame number padded with  leading  zeros  as
              name.  24bpp RGB and BGR formats are supported.
                 z=<0-9>
                      Specifies the compression level.  0 is no compression, 9
                      is maximum compression.
                 outdir=<dirname>
                      Specify the directory to save the PNG files to (default:
                      ./).
                 alpha
                      Create  PNG  files  with  an  alpha  channel.  Note that
                      MPlayer in general does not support alpha, so this  will
                      only be useful in some rare cases.

       tga
              Output  each  frame  into a Targa file in the current directory.
              Each file takes the frame number padded with  leading  zeros  as
              name.  The purpose of this video output driver is to have a sim-
              ple lossless image writer to use without any  external  library.
              It  supports  the  BGR[A]  color format, with 15, 24 and 32 bpp.
              You can force a particular format with the format video  filter.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer video.nut -vf format=bgr15 -vo tga

DECODING/FILTERING OPTIONS
       -ac <[-|+]codec1,[-|+]codec2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of audio codecs to be used, according to
              their codec name in codecs.conf.  Use a  '-'  before  the  codec
              name  to  omit it.  Use a '+' before the codec name to force it,
              this will likely crash!  If the list has a trailing ','  MPlayer
              will fall back on codecs not contained in the list.
              NOTE: See -ac help for a full list of available codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ac mp3acm
                      Force the l3codeca.acm MP3 codec.
                 -ac mad,
                      Try libmad first, then fall back on others.
                 -ac hwac3,a52,
                      Try  hardware AC-3 passthrough, software AC-3, then oth-
                      ers.
                 -ac hwdts,
                      Try hardware DTS passthrough, then fall back on  others.

       -af-adv <force=(0-7):list=(filters)> (also see -af)
              Specify advanced audio filter options:

                 force=<0-7>
                      Forces the insertion of audio filters to one of the fol-
                      lowing:
                         0: Use completely automatic filter insertion.
                         1: Optimize for accuracy (default).
                         2: Optimize for speed.  Warning: Some features in the
                         audio filters may silently fail, and the sound quali-
                         ty may drop.
                         3: Use no automatic insertion of filters and no opti-
                         mization.   Warning:  It  may  be  possible  to crash
                         MPlayer using this setting.
                         4: Use automatic insertion of filters according to  0
                         above,  but use floating point processing when possi-
                         ble.
                         5: Use automatic insertion of filters according to  1
                         above,  but use floating point processing when possi-
                         ble.
                         6: Use automatic insertion of filters according to  2
                         above,  but use floating point processing when possi-
                         ble.
                         7: Use no automatic insertion of filters according to
                         3  above, and use floating point processing when pos-
                         sible.

                 list=<filters>
                      Same as -af.

       -afm <driver1,driver2,...>
              Specify a priority list of audio codec families to be used,  ac-
              cording  to  their codec name in codecs.conf.  Falls back on the
              default codecs if none of the given codec families work.
              NOTE: See -afm help for a full list of available codec families.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -afm ffmpeg
                      Try FFmpeg's libavcodec codecs first.
                 -afm acm,dshow
                      Try Win32 codecs first.

       -aspect <ratio> (also see -zoom)
              Override  movie  aspect ratio, in case aspect information is in-
              correct or missing in the file being played.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -aspect 4:3  or -aspect 1.3333
                 -aspect 16:9 or -aspect 1.7777

       -noaspect
              Disable automatic movie aspect ratio compensation.

       -field-dominance <-1-1>
              Set first field for interlaced content.  Useful for  deinterlac-
              ers  that  double the framerate: -vf tfields=1, -vf yadif=1, -vo
              vdpau:deint and -vo xvmc:bobdeint.
                 -1   auto (default): If the decoder does not export  the  ap-
                      propriate  information,  it  falls  back to 0 (top field
                      first).
                 0    top field first
                 1    bottom field first

       -flip
              Flip image upside-down.

       -lavdopts <option1:option2:...> (DEBUG CODE)
              Specify libavcodec decoding parameters.  Separate  multiple  op-
              tions with a colon.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -lavdopts gray:skiploopfilter=all:skipframe=nonref

              Available options are:

                 bitexact
                      Only use bit-exact algorithms in all decoding steps (for
                      codec testing).

                 bug=<value>

                         files (no autodetection)
                         4  (mpeg4):  Xvid  interlacing  bug  (autodetected if

                         0x2000: Visualize quantization parameter (QP),  lower
                         QP are tinted greener.
                         0x4000: Visualize block types.

                 ec=<value>
                      Set error concealment strategy.
                         1: Use strong deblock filter for damaged MBs.
                         2: iterative motion vector (MV) search (slow)
                         3: all (default)

                 er=<value>
                      Set error resilience strategy.
                         0: disabled
                         1: careful (Should work with broken encoders.)
                         2:  normal (default) (Works with compliant encoders.)
                         3: aggressive (More checks, but might cause  problems
                         even for valid bitstreams.)
                         4: very aggressive

                 fast (MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and H.264 only)
                      Enable optimizations which do not comply to the specifi-
                      cation and might potentially cause problems,  like  sim-
                      pler dequantization, simpler motion compensation, assum-
                      ing use of the default quantization matrix, assuming YUV
                      4:2:0  and  skipping a few checks to detect damaged bit-
                      streams.

                 gray
                      grayscale only decoding (a bit faster than with color)

                 idct=<0-99> (see -lavcopts)
                      For best decoding quality use the  same  IDCT  algorithm
                      for  decoding and encoding.  This may come at a price in
                      accuracy, though.

                 lowres=<number>[,<w>]
                      Decode at lower resolutions.  Low resolution decoding is
                      not supported by all codecs, and it will often result in
                      ugly artifacts.  This is not a bug, but a side effect of
                      not decoding at full resolution.
                         0: disabled
                         1: 1/2 resolution
                         2: 1/4 resolution
                         3: 1/8 resolution
                      If <w> is specified lowres decoding will be used only if
                      the width of the video is major than or equal to <w>.
                 o=<key>=<value>[,<key>=<value>[,...]]   Pass   AVOptions   to
                 libavcodec  decoder.   Note,  a patch to make the o= unneeded
                 and pass all unknown options through the AVOption  system  is
                 welcome.  A full list of AVOptions can be found in the FFmpeg
                 manual.  Note that some options may  conflict  with  MEncoder
                 options.

                      EXAMPLE:
                           o=debug=pict

                 sb=<number> (MPEG-2 only)
                      Skip  the given number of macroblock rows at the bottom.

                 st=<number> (MPEG-2 only)
                      Skip the given number of macroblock rows at the top.

                 skiploopfilter=<skipvalue> (H.264 only)
                      Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264  de-
                      coding.  Since the filtered frame is supposed to be used
                      as reference for decoding dependent frames  this  has  a
                      worse  effect  on  quality  than not doing deblocking on
                      e.g. MPEG-2 video.  But at least for high  bitrate  HDTV
                      this  provides  a  big  speedup  with no visible quality
                      loss.

                      <skipvalue> can be either one of the following:
                         none: Never skip.
                         default: Skip useless processing steps (e.g.  0  size
                         packets in AVI).
                         nonref: Skip frames that are not referenced (i.e. not
                         used for decoding  other  frames,  the  error  cannot
                         "build up").
                         bidir: Skip B-Frames.
                         nonkey: Skip all frames except keyframes.
                         all: Skip all frames.

                 skipidct=<skipvalue> (MPEG-1/2 only)
                      Skips  the IDCT step.  This degrades quality a lot of in
                      almost all cases (see skiploopfilter for available  skip
                      values).

                 skipframe=<skipvalue>
                      Skips  decoding  of frames completely.  Big speedup, but
                      jerky motion and sometimes bad artifacts (see  skiploop-
                      filter for available skip values).

                 threads=<1-8> (MPEG-1/2 and H.264 only)
                      number of threads to use for decoding (default: 1)

                 vismv=<value>
                      Visualize motion vectors.
                         0: disabled
                         1: Visualize forward predicted MVs of P-frames.
                         2: Visualize forward predicted MVs of B-frames.
                         4: Visualize backward predicted MVs of B-frames.

                 vstats
                      Prints   some   statistics  and  stores  them  in  ./vs-
                      tats_*.log.

       -noslices
              Disable drawing video by 16-pixel height  slices/bands,  instead
              draws the whole frame in a single run.  May be faster or slower,
              depending on video card and available cache.  It has effect only
              with libmpeg2 and libavcodec codecs.

       -nosound
              Do not play/encode sound.  Useful for benchmarking.

       -novideo
              Do not play/encode video.  In many cases this will not work, use
              -vc null -vo null instead.

       -pp <quality> (also see -vf pp)
              Set the DLL postprocess level.  This option is no longer  usable
              with  -vf pp.  It only works with Win32 DirectShow DLLs with in-
              ternal postprocessing routines.  The valid range of  -pp  values
              varies  by  codec, it is mostly 0-6, where 0=disable, 6=slowest/
              best.

       -pphelp (also see -vf pp)
              Show a summary about the available postprocess filters and their
              usage.

       -ssf <mode>
              Specifies software scaler parameters.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vf scale -ssf lgb=3.0
                 lgb=<0-100>
                      gaussian blur filter (luma)
                 cgb=<0-100>
                      gaussian blur filter (chroma)
                 ls=<-100-100>
                      sharpen filter (luma)
                 cs=<-100-100>
                      sharpen filter (chroma)
                 chs=<h>
                      chroma horizontal shifting
                 cvs=<v>
                      chroma vertical shifting

       -stereo <mode>
              Select type of MP2/MP3 stereo output.
                 0    stereo
                 1    left channel
                 2    right channel

       -sws <software scaler type> (also see -vf scale and -zoom)
              Specify  the software scaler algorithm to be used with the -zoom
              option.  This affects video output drivers which  lack  hardware
              acceleration, e.g. x11.

              Available types are:

                 0    fast bilinear
                 1    bilinear
                 2    bicubic (good quality) (default)
                 3    experimental
                 4    nearest neighbor (bad quality)
                 5    area
                 6    luma bicubic / chroma bilinear
                 7    gauss
                 8    sincR
                 9    lanczos
                 10   natural bicubic spline

              NOTE:  Some  -sws  options  are tunable.  The description of the
              scale video filter has further information.

       -vc <[-|+]codec1,[-|+]codec2,...[,]>
              Specify a priority list of video codecs to be used, according to
              their  codec  name  in  codecs.conf.  Use a '-' before the codec
              name to omit it.  Use a '+' before the codec name to  force  it,
              this  will likely crash!  If the list has a trailing ',' MPlayer
              will fall back on codecs not contained in the list.
              NOTE: See -vc help for a full list of available codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vc divx
                      Force Win32/VfW DivX codec, no fallback.
                 -vc -divxds,-divx,
                      Skip Win32 DivX codecs.
                 -vc ffmpeg12,mpeg12,
                      Try libavcodec's MPEG-1/2  codec,  then  libmpeg2,  then
                      others.

       -vfm <driver1,driver2,...>
              Specify  a priority list of video codec families to be used, ac-
              cording to their names in codecs.conf.  Falls back  on  the  de-
              fault codecs if none of the given codec families work.
              NOTE: See -vfm help for a full list of available codec families.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vfm ffmpeg,dshow,vfw
                      Try the libavcodec, then Directshow, then VfW codecs and
                      fall back on others, if they do not work.
                 -vfm xanim
                      Try XAnim codecs first.

       -x <x> (also see -zoom) (MPlayer only)
              Scale image to width <x> (if software/hardware scaling is avail-
              able).  Disables aspect calculations.

       -xvidopts <option1:option2:...>
              Specify additional parameters when decoding with Xvid.
              NOTE: Since libavcodec is faster than Xvid you might want to use
              the  libavcodec postprocessing filter (-vf pp) and decoder (-vfm
              ffmpeg) instead.

              Xvid's internal postprocessing filters:
                 deblock-chroma (also see -vf pp)
                      chroma deblock filter
                 deblock-luma (also see -vf pp)
                      luma deblock filter
                 dering-luma (also see -vf pp)
                      luma deringing filter
                 dering-chroma (also see -vf pp)
                      chroma deringing filter
                 filmeffect (also see -vf noise)
                      Adds artificial film grain to the video.   May  increase
                      perceived quality, while lowering true quality.

              rendering methods:
                 dr2
                      Activate direct rendering method 2.
                 nodr2
                      Deactivate direct rendering method 2.

       -xy <value> (also see -zoom)
                 value<=8
                      Scale image by factor <value>.
                 value>8
                      Set  width to value and calculate height to keep correct
                      aspect ratio.

       -y <y> (also see -zoom) (MPlayer only)
              Scale image to  height  <y>  (if  software/hardware  scaling  is
              available).  Disables aspect calculations.

       -zoom
              Allow  software scaling, where available.  This will allow scal-
              ing with output drivers (like x11, fbdev) that  do  not  support
              hardware  scaling  where MPlayer disables scaling by default for
              performance reasons.

AUDIO FILTERS
       Audio filters allow you to modify the audio stream and its  properties.
       The syntax is:

       -af <filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...>
              Setup a chain of audio filters.

       NOTE: To get a full list of available audio filters, see -af help.

       Audio filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage
       the filter list.

       -af-add <filter1[,filter2,...]>
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -af-pre <filter1[,filter2,...]>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -af-del <index1[,index2,...]>
              Deletes the filters at the given indexes.  Index  numbers  start
              at  0,  negative  numbers address the end of the list (-1 is the
              last).

       -af-clr
              Completely empties the filter list.

       Available filters are:

       resample[=srate[:sloppy[:type]]]
              Changes the sample rate of the audio stream.  Can be used if you
              have  a  fixed  frequency sound card or if you are stuck with an
              old sound card that is only capable of max 44.1kHz.  This filter
              is  automatically enabled if necessary.  It only supports 16-bit
              integer and float in native-endian format as input.
              NOTE: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate <srate>.
                 <srate>
                      output sample frequency in Hz.  The valid range for this
                      parameter  is  8000  to 192000.  If the input and output
                      sample frequency are the same or if  this  parameter  is
                      omitted  the  filter  is automatically unloaded.  A high
                      sample frequency normally improves  the  audio  quality,
                      especially  when used in combination with other filters.
                 <sloppy>
                      Allow (1) or disallow (0) the output frequency to differ
                      slightly  from  the frequency given by <srate> (default:
                      1).  Can be used if the startup of the playback  is  ex-
                      tremely slow.
                 <type>
                      Select which resampling method to use.
                         0: linear interpolation (fast, poor quality especial-
                         ly when upsampling)
                         1: polyphase filterbank and integer processing
                         2: polyphase filterbank and floating point processing
                         (slow, best quality)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af resample=44100:0:0
                      would set the output frequency of the resample filter to
                      44100Hz using exact output frequency scaling and  linear
                      interpolation.

       lavcresample[=srate[:length[:linear[:count[:cutoff]]]]]
              Changes  the  sample  rate  of  the  audio  stream to an integer
              <srate> in Hz.  It only supports the 16-bit  native-endian  for-
              mat.
              NOTE: With MEncoder, you need to also use -srate <srate>.
                 <srate>
                      the output sample rate
                 <length>
                      length  of the filter with respect to the lower sampling
                      rate (default: 16)
                 <linear>
                      if 1 then filters will be linearly interpolated  between
                      polyphase entries
                 <count>
                      log2  of the number of polyphase entries (..., 10->1024,
                      11->2048, 12->4096, ...)  (default: 10->1024)
                 <cutoff>
                      cutoff frequency (0.0-1.0), default set  depending  upon
                      filter length

       lavcac3enc[=tospdif[:bitrate[:minchn]]]
              Encode  multi-channel audio to AC-3 at runtime using libavcodec.
              Supports 16-bit native-endian input format, maximum 6  channels.
              The  output is big-endian when outputting a raw AC-3 stream, na-
              tive-endian when outputting to S/PDIF.  The output  sample  rate
              of  this  filter is same with the input sample rate.  When input
              sample rate is 48kHz, 44.1kHz, or 32kHz,  this  filter  directly
              use  it.   Otherwise a resampling filter is auto-inserted before
              this filter to make the input and output sample rate  be  48kHz.
              You need to specify '-channels N' to make the decoder decode au-
              dio into N-channel, then the filter can encode the N-channel in-
              put to AC-3.
                 <tospdif>
                      Output  raw  AC-3  stream  if zero or not set, output to
                      S/PDIF for passthrough when <tospdif> is set non-zero.
                 <bitrate>
                      The bitrate to encode the AC-3 stream.  Set it to either
                      384  or  384000  to get 384kbits.  Valid values: 32, 40,
                      48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256,
                                    320, 384, 448, 512, 576, 640  Default  bi-
                      trate  is  based  on  the input channel number: 1ch: 96,
                      2ch: 192,  3ch: 224,  4ch: 384,  5ch: 448,  6ch: 448
                 <minchn>
                      If the input channel number is less than  <minchn>,  the
                      filter will detach itself (default: 5).

       sweep[=speed]
              Produces a sine sweep.
                 <0.0-1.0>
                      Sine  function  delta,  use  very low values to hear the
                      sweep.

       sinesuppress[=freq:decay]
              Remove a sine at the specified frequency.  Useful to get rid  of
              the  50/60Hz  noise on low quality audio equipment.  It probably
              only works on mono input.
                 <freq>
                      The frequency of the sine which should  be  removed  (in
                      Hz) (default: 50)
                 <decay>
                      Controls  the  adaptivity  (a larger value will make the
                      filter adapt to amplitude and phase changes  quicker,  a
                      smaller value will make the adaptation slower) (default:
                      0.0001).  Reasonable values are around 0.001.

       bs2b[=option1:option2:...]
              Bauer stereophonic to  binaural  transformation  using  libbs2b.
              Improves  the headphone listening experience by making the sound
              similar to that from loudspeakers, allowing  each  ear  to  hear
              both  channels  and  taking into account the distance difference
              and the head shadowing effect.  It is applicable only to 2 chan-
              nel audio.
                 fcut=<300-1000>
                      Set cut frequency in Hz.
                 feed=<10-150>
                      Set feed level for low frequencies in 0.1*dB.
                 profile=<value>
                      Several profiles are available for convenience:
                           default
                                will  be  used  if  nothing else was specified
                                (fcut=700, feed=45)
                           cmoy
                                Chu  Moy  circuit  implementation   (fcut=700,
                                feed=60)
                           jmeier
                                Jan  Meier  circuit  implementation (fcut=650,
                                feed=95)

              If fcut or feed options are specified together with  a  profile,
              they will be applied on top of the selected profile.

       hrtf[=flag]
              Head-related transfer function: Converts multichannel audio to 2
              channel output for headphones, preserving the spatiality of  the
              sound.

              Flag  Meaning
              m     matrix decoding of the rear channel

       equalizer=[g1:g2:g3:...:g10]
              10  octave band graphic equalizer, implemented using 10 IIR band
              pass filters.  This means that it works regardless of what  type
              of  audio  is being played back.  The center frequencies for the
              10 bands are:

              No. frequency
              0    31.25 Hz
              1    62.50 Hz
              2   125.00 Hz
              3   250.00 Hz
              4   500.00 Hz
              5    1.00 kHz
              6    2.00 kHz
              7    4.00 kHz
              8    8.00 kHz
              9   16.00 kHz

              If the sample rate of the sound being played is lower  than  the
              center  frequency  for  a frequency band, then that band will be
              disabled.  A known bug with this filter is that the characteris-
              tics  for the uppermost band are not completely symmetric if the
              sample rate is close to the center frequency of that band.  This
              problem  can  be worked around by upsampling the sound using the
              resample filter before it reaches this filter.
                 <g1>:<g2>:<g3>:...:<g10>
                      floating point numbers representing the gain in  dB  for
                      each frequency band (-12-12)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af equalizer=11:11:10:5:0:-12:0:5:12:12 media.avi
                      Would amplify the sound in the upper and lower frequency
                      region while canceling it almost completely around 1kHz.

       channels=nch[:nr:from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...]
              Can  be  used  for  adding,  removing, routing and copying audio
              channels.  If only <nch> is given the default routing  is  used,
              it  works as follows: If the number of output channels is bigger
              than the number of input channels empty  channels  are  inserted
              (except mixing from mono to stereo, then the mono channel is re-
              peated in both of the output channels).  If the number of output
              channels  is  smaller  than the number of input channels the ex-
              ceeding channels are truncated.
                 <nch>
                      number of output channels (1-8)
                 <nr>
                      number of routes (1-8)
                 <from1:to1:from2:to2:from3:to3:...>
                      Pairs of numbers between 0 and 7 that  define  where  to
                      route each channel.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af channels=4:4:0:1:1:0:2:2:3:3 media.avi
                      Would  change  the  number of channels to 4 and set up 4
                      routes that swap channel 0 and channel 1 and leave chan-
                      nel  2  and  3 intact.  Observe that if media containing
                      two channels was played back, channels  2  and  3  would
                      contain silence but 0 and 1 would still be swapped.
                 mplayer -af channels=6:4:0:0:0:1:0:2:0:3 media.avi
                      Would  change  the  number of channels to 6 and set up 4
                      routes that copy channel 0 to channels 0 to 3.   Channel
                      4 and 5 will contain silence.

       format[=format] (also see -format)
              Convert between different sample formats.  Automatically enabled
              when needed by the sound card or another filter.
                 <format>
                      Sets the desired format.  The  general  form  is  'sbe',
                      where 's' denotes the sign (either 's' for signed or 'u'
                      for unsigned), 'b' denotes the number of bits per sample
                      (16,  24  or  32)  and  'e' denotes the endianness ('le'
                      means little-endian, 'be' big-endian and 'ne' the  endi-
                      anness  of  the  computer MPlayer is running on).  Valid
                      values  (amongst  others)  are:  's16le',  'u32be'   and
                      'u24ne'.   Exceptions  to  this rule that are also valid
                      format specifiers: u8, s8,  floatle,  floatbe,  floatne,
                      mulaw, alaw, mpeg2, ac3 and imaadpcm.

       volume[=v[:sc]]
              Implements  software  volume control.  Use this filter with cau-
              tion since it can reduce the signal to noise ratio of the sound.
              In  most  cases it is best to set the level for the PCM sound to
              max, leave this filter out and control the output level to  your
              speakers  with  the master volume control of the mixer.  In case
              your sound card has a digital PCM mixer  instead  of  an  analog
              one,  and you hear distortion, use the MASTER mixer instead.  If
              there is an external amplifier connected to the  computer  (this
              is  almost always the case), the noise level can be minimized by
              adjusting the master level and the volume knob on the  amplifier
              until the hissing noise in the background is gone.
              This  filter has a second feature: It measures the overall maxi-
              mum sound level and prints out that level  when  MPlayer  exits.
              This  volume estimate can be used for setting the sound level in
              MEncoder such that the maximum dynamic range is utilized.
              NOTE: This filter is not reentrant and can therefore only be en-
              abled once for every audio stream.
                 <v>
                      Sets  the  desired  gain  in  dB for all channels in the
                      stream from -200dB to  +60dB,  where  -200dB  mutes  the
                      sound  completely  and  +60dB equals a gain of 1000 (de-
                      fault: 0).
                 <sc>
                      Turns soft clipping on (1) or  off  (0).   Soft-clipping
                      can  make the sound more smooth if very high volume lev-
                      els are used.  Enable this option if the  dynamic  range
                      of the loudspeakers is very low.
                      WARNING:  This  feature creates distortion and should be
                      considered a last resort.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af volume=10.1:0 media.avi
                      Would amplify the sound by 10.1dB and hard-clip  if  the
                      sound level is too high.

       pan=n[:L00:L01:L02:...L10:L11:L12:...Ln0:Ln1:Ln2:...]
              Mixes channels arbitrarily.  Basically a combination of the vol-
              ume and the channels filter that can be used  to  down-mix  many
              channels  to only a few, e.g. stereo to mono or vary the "width"
              of the center speaker in a surround sound system.   This  filter
              is  hard  to use, and will require some tinkering before the de-
              sired result is obtained.  The number of options for this filter
              depends  on  the  number  of output channels.  An example how to
              downmix a six-channel file to two channels with this filter  can
              be found in the examples section near the end.
                 <n>
                      number of output channels (1-8)
                 <Lij>
                      How much of input channel i is mixed into output channel
                      j (0-1).  So in principle you first have n numbers  say-
                      ing what to do with the first input channel, then n num-
                      bers that act on the second input channel etc.   If  you
                      do not specify any numbers for some input channels, 0 is
                      assumed.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af pan=1:0.5:0.5 media.avi
                      Would down-mix from stereo to mono.
                 mplayer -af pan=3:1:0:0.5:0:1:0.5 media.avi
                      Would give 3 channel output leaving channels 0 and 1 in-
                      tact,  and  mix  channels  0 and 1 into output channel 2
                      (which could be sent to a subwoofer for example).

       sub[=fc:ch]
              Adds a subwoofer channel to the audio stream.   The  audio  data
              used  for  creating  the  subwoofer channel is an average of the
              sound in channel 0 and channel 1.  The resulting sound  is  then
              low-pass  filtered  by a 4th order Butterworth filter with a de-
              fault cutoff frequency of 60Hz and added to a  separate  channel
              in the audio stream.
              Warning: Disable this filter when you are playing DVDs with Dol-
              by Digital 5.1 sound, otherwise this  filter  will  disrupt  the
              sound to the subwoofer.
                 <fc>
                      cutoff  frequency in Hz for the low-pass filter (20Hz to
                      300Hz) (default: 60Hz) For the best result  try  setting
                      the  cutoff frequency as low as possible.  This will im-
                      prove the stereo or surround sound experience.
                 <ch>
                      Determines the channel number in  which  to  insert  the
                      sub-channel  audio.  Channel number can be between 0 and
                      7 (default: 5).  Observe that  the  number  of  channels
                      will automatically be increased to <ch> if necessary.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af sub=100:4 -channels 5 media.avi
                      Would  add  a sub-woofer channel with a cutoff frequency
                      of 100Hz to output channel 4.

       center
              Creates a center channel from the front channels.  May currently
              be  low  quality as it does not implement a high-pass filter for
              proper extraction yet, but averages and halves the channels  in-
              stead.
                 <ch>
                      Determines  the  channel  number  in which to insert the
                      center channel.  Channel number can be between 0  and  7
                      (default:  5).  Observe that the number of channels will
                      automatically be increased to <ch> if necessary.

       surround[=delay]
              Decoder for matrix encoded surround sound like  Dolby  Surround.
              Many  files  with 2 channel audio actually contain matrixed sur-
              round sound.  Requires a sound card supporting at least 4  chan-
              nels.
                 <delay>
                      delay  time in ms for the rear speakers (0 to 1000) (de-
                      fault: 20) This delay should be set as follows: If d1 is
                      the  distance  from  the listening position to the front
                      speakers and d2 is the distance from the listening posi-
                      tion  to the rear speakers, then the delay should be set
                      to 15ms if d1 <= d2 and to 15 + 5*(d1-d2) if d1 > d2.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af surround=15 -channels 4 media.avi
                      Would add surround sound decoding with  15ms  delay  for
                      the sound to the rear speakers.

       delay[=ch1:ch2:...]
              Delays  the  sound  to the loudspeakers such that the sound from
              the different channels arrives at the listening position  simul-
              taneously.  It is only useful if you have more than 2 loudspeak-
              ers.
                 ch1,ch2,...
                      The delay in ms that should be imposed on  each  channel
                      (floating point number between 0 and 1000).

              To calculate the required delay for the different channels do as
              follows:

              1. Measure the distance to the loudspeakers in meters  in  rela-
                 tion  to your listening position, giving you the distances s1
                 to s5 (for a 5.1 system).  There is no point in  compensating
                 for  the subwoofer (you will not hear the difference anyway).

              2. Subtract the distances s1 to s5 from  the  maximum  distance,
                 i.e. s[i] = max(s) - s[i]; i = 1...5.

              3. Calculate  the required delays in ms as d[i] = 1000*s[i]/342;
                 i = 1...5.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af delay=10.5:10.5:0:0:7:0 media.avi
                      Would delay front left and right by 10.5ms, the two rear
                      channels  and  the  sub by 0ms and the center channel by
                      7ms.

       export[=mmapped_file[:nsamples]]
              Exports the incoming signal to other processes using memory map-
              ping (mmap()).  Memory mapped areas contain a header:

              int nch                      /*number of channels*/
              int size                     /*buffer size*/
              unsigned long long counter   /*Used to keep sync, updated every
                                             time new data is exported.*/

              The rest is payload (non-interleaved) 16 bit data.
                 <mmapped_file>
                      file  to map data to (default: ~/.mplayer/mplayer-af_ex-
                      port)
                 <nsamples>
                      number of samples per channel (default: 512)

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af export=/tmp/mplayer-af_export:1024 media.avi
                      Would export 1024 samples per channel to  '/tmp/mplayer-
                      af_export'.

       extrastereo[=mul]
              (Linearly) increases the difference between left and right chan-
              nels which adds some sort of "live" effect to playback.
                 <mul>
                      Sets the difference  coefficient  (default:  2.5).   0.0
                      means  mono  sound  (average of both channels), with 1.0
                      sound will be unchanged, with -1.0 left and right  chan-
                      nels will be swapped.

       volnorm[=method:target]
              Maximizes the volume without distorting the sound.
                 <method>
                      Sets the used method.
                         1:  Use  a single sample to smooth the variations via
                         the standard weighted mean  over  past  samples  (de-
                         fault).
                         2:  Use  several samples to smooth the variations via
                         the standard weighted mean over past samples.

                 <target>
                      Sets the target amplitude as a fraction of  the  maximum
                      for the sample type (default: 0.25).

       ladspa=file:label[:controls...]
              Load  a LADSPA (Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) plug-
              in.  This filter is reentrant, so multiple LADSPA plugins can be
              used at once.
                 <file>
                      Specifies   the   LADSPA   plugin   library   file.   If
                      LADSPA_PATH is set, it searches for the specified  file.
                      If  it  is  not  set,  you must supply a fully specified
                      pathname.
                 <label>
                      Specifies the filter within the library.  Some libraries
                      contain  only  one  filter,  but  others contain many of
                      them.  Entering 'help' here,  will  list  all  available
                      filters  within  the specified library, which eliminates
                      the use of 'listplugins' from the LADSPA SDK.
                 <controls>
                      Controls are zero or more floating point values that de-
                      termine  the  behavior of the loaded plugin (for example
                      delay, threshold or gain).  In verbose mode (add  -v  to
                      the  MPlayer  command  line), all available controls and
                      their valid ranges are printed.  This eliminates the use
                      of 'analyseplugin' from the LADSPA SDK.

       comp
              Compressor/expander  filter  usable  for microphone input.  Pre-
              vents artifacts on very loud sound and raises the volume on very
              low sound.  This filter is untested, maybe even unusable.

       gate
              Noise gate filter similar to the comp audio filter.  This filter
              is untested, maybe even unusable.

       karaoke
              Simple voice removal filter exploiting the fact  that  voice  is
              usually  recorded  with  mono gear and later 'center' mixed onto
              the final audio stream.  Beware that this filter will turn  your
              signal into mono.  Works well for 2 channel tracks; do not both-
              er trying it on anything but 2 channel stereo.

       scaletempo[=option1:option2:...]
              Scales audio tempo without altering pitch, optionally synced  to
              playback speed (default).
              This  works by playing ´stride´ ms of audio at normal speed then
              consuming ´stride*scale´ ms  of  input  audio.   It  pieces  the
              strides  together  by  blending  ´overlap´% of stride with audio
              following the previous stride.  It optionally performs  a  short
              statistical  analysis on the next ´search´ ms of audio to deter-
              mine the best overlap position.
                 scale=<amount>
                      Nominal amount to scale tempo.  Scales  this  amount  in
                      addition to speed.  (default: 1.0)
                 stride=<amount>
                      Length  in milliseconds to output each stride.  Too high
                      of value  will  cause  noticable  skips  at  high  scale
                      amounts and an echo at low scale amounts.  Very low val-
                      ues will alter pitch.  Increasing improves  performance.
                      (default: 60)
                 overlap=<percent>
                      Percentage  of  stride  to overlap.  Decreasing improves
                      performance.  (default: .20)
                 search=<amount>
                      Length in milliseconds to search for best overlap  posi-
                      tion.  Decreasing improves performance greatly.  On slow
                      systems, you will probably want to set  this  very  low.
                      (default: 14)
                 speed=<tempo|pitch|both|none>
                      Set response to speed change.
                         tempo
                              Scale tempo in sync with speed (default).
                         pitch
                              Reverses effect of filter.  Scales pitch without
                              altering    tempo.     Add     ´[     speed_mult
                              0.9438743126816935´     and     ´]    speed_mult
                              1.059463094352953´ to your input.conf to step by
                              musical  semi-tones.   WARNING:  Loses sync with
                              video.
                         both Scale both tempo and pitch.
                         none Ignore speed changes.

              EXAMPLE:
                 mplayer -af scaletempo -speed 1.2 media.ogg
                      Would playback media at 1.2x normal speed, with audio at
                      normal pitch.  Changing playback speed, would change au-
                      dio tempo to match.
                 mplayer -af scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=none  -speed  1.2  me-
                 dia.ogg
                      Would playback media at 1.2x normal speed, with audio at
                      normal  pitch, but changing playback speed has no effect
                      on audio tempo.
                 mplayer  -af  scaletempo=stride=30:overlap=.50:search=10  me-
                 dia.ogg
                      Would tweak the quality and performace parameters.
                 mplayer -af format=floatne,scaletempo media.ogg
                      Would make scaletempo use float code.  Maybe  faster  on
                      some platforms.
                 mplayer -af scaletempo=scale=1.2:speed=pitch audio.ogg
                      Would playback audio file at 1.2x normal speed, with au-
                      dio at normal pitch.   Changing  playback  speed,  would
                      change pitch, leaving audio tempo at 1.2x.

       stats
              Collects and prints statistics about the audio stream, especial-
              ly the volume.  These statistics are especially intended to help
              adjusting  the  volume while avoiding clipping.  The volumes are
              printed in dB and compatible with the volume audio filter.

VIDEO FILTERS
       Video filters allow you to modify the video stream and its  properties.
       The syntax is:

       -vf <filter1[=parameter1:parameter2:...],filter2,...>
              Setup a chain of video filters.

       Many  parameters are optional and set to default values if omitted.  To
       explicitly use a default value set a parameter to '-1'.  Parameters w:h
       means width x height in pixels, x:y means x;y position counted from the
       upper left corner of the bigger image.
       NOTE: To get a full list of available video filters, see -vf help.

       Video filters are managed in lists.  There are a few commands to manage
       the filter list.

       -vf-add <filter1[,filter2,...]>
              Appends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -vf-pre <filter1[,filter2,...]>
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list.

       -vf-del <index1[,index2,...]>
              Deletes  the  filters at the given indexes.  Index numbers start
              at 0, negative numbers address the end of the list  (-1  is  the
              last).

       -vf-clr
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With  filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

       -vf <filter>=help
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a par-
              ticular filter.

       -vf <filter=named_parameter1=value1[:named_parameter2=value2:...]>
              Sets  a  named  parameter to the given value.  Use on and off or
              yes and no to set flag parameters.

       Available filters are:

       crop[=w:h:x:y]
              Crops the given part of the image and discards the rest.  Useful
              to remove black bands from widescreen movies.
                 <w>,<h>
                      Cropped width and height, defaults to original width and
                      height.
                 <x>,<y>
                      Position of the cropped picture, defaults to center.

       cropdetect[=limit:round]
              Calculates necessary cropping parameters and prints  the  recom-
              mended parameters to stdout.
                 <limit>
                      Threshold,  which can be optionally specified from noth-
                      ing (0) to everything (255) (default: 24).
                 <round>
                      Value which the width/height should be divisible by (de-
                      fault:  16).   The  offset  is automatically adjusted to
                      center the video.  Use 2 to  get  only  even  dimensions
                      (needed  for  4:2:2 video).  16 is best when encoding to
                      most video codecs.

       rectangle[=w:h:x:y]
              Draws a rectangle of the requested width and height at the spec-
              ified  coordinates  over  the image and prints current rectangle
              parameters to the console.  This can be  used  to  find  optimal
              cropping  parameters.   If  you  bind  the  input.conf directive
              'change_rectangle' to keystrokes, you can move  and  resize  the
              rectangle on the fly.
                 <w>,<h>
                      width  and  height  (default: -1, maximum possible width
                      where boundaries are still visible.)
                 <x>,<y>
                      top left corner position (default: -1,  uppermost  left-
                      most)

       expand[=w:h:x:y:o:a:r]
              Expands  (not  scales)  movie  resolution to the given value and
              places the unscaled original at coordinates x, y.  Can  be  used
              for placing subtitles/OSD in the resulting black bands.

                 <w>,<h>
                      Expanded  width,height (default: original width,height).
                      Negative values for w and h are treated  as  offsets  to
                      the original size.

                      EXAMPLE:
                           expand=0:-50:0:0
                                  Adds  a 50 pixel border to the bottom of the
                                  picture.

                 <x>,<y>
                      position of original image on the  expanded  image  (de-
                      fault: center)

                 <o>
                      OSD/subtitle rendering
                         0: disable (default)
                         1: enable

                 <a>
                      Expands  to  fit  an aspect instead of a resolution (de-
                      fault: 0).

                      EXAMPLE:
                           expand=800:::::4/3
                                  Expands to 800x600,  unless  the  source  is
                                  higher  resolution, in which case it expands
                                  to fill a 4/3 aspect.

                 <r>
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by <r>
                      (default: 1).

       flip (also see -flip)
              Flips the image upside down.

       mirror
              Mirrors the image on the Y axis.

       rotate[=<0-7>]
              Rotates  the  image  by 90 degrees and optionally flips it.  For
              values between 4-7 rotation is only done if the  movie  geometry
              is portrait and not landscape.

                 0    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip (default).

                 1    Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

                 2    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

                 3    Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and flip.

       scale[=w:h[:interlaced[:chr_drop[:par[:par2[:pre-
       size[:noup[:arnd]]]]]]]]
              Scales  the image with the software scaler (slow) and performs a
              YUV<->RGB colorspace conversion (also see -sws).

                 <w>,<h>
                      scaled width/height (default: original width/height)
                      NOTE: If -zoom is used, and underlying filters  (includ-
                      ing  libvo)  are  incapable  of  scaling, it defaults to
                      d_width/d_height!
                          0:   scaled d_width/d_height
                         -1:   original width/height
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         prescaled aspect ratio.
                         -3:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original aspect ratio.
                         -(n+8): Like -n above, but rounding the dimension  to
                         the closest multiple of 16.

                 <interlaced>
                      Toggle interlaced scaling.
                         0: off (default)

                 <chr_drop>
                      chroma skipping
                         0: Use all available input lines for chroma.
                         1: Use only every 2. input line for chroma.
                         2: Use only every 4. input line for chroma.
                         3: Use only every 8. input line for chroma.

                 <par>[:<par2>] (also see -sws)
                      Set  some  scaling  parameters  depending on the type of
                      scaler selected with -sws.
                         -sws 2 (bicubic):  B (blurring) and C (ringing)
                         0.00:0.60 default
                         0.00:0.75 VirtualDub's "precise bicubic"
                         0.00:0.50 Catmull-Rom spline
                         0.33:0.33 Mitchell-Netravali spline
                         1.00:0.00 cubic B-spline

                 <noup>
                      Disallow upscaling past the original dimensions.
                         0: Allow upscaling (default).
                         1:  Disallow  upscaling  if one dimension exceeds its
                         original value.
                         2: Disallow upscaling if both dimensions exceed their
                         original values.

                 <arnd>

                      faster or slower than the default rounding.
                         0: Disable accurate rounding (default).
                         1: Enable accurate rounding.

       dsize[=aspect|w:h:aspect-method:r]
              Changes the intended display size/aspect at an  arbitrary  point
              in the filter chain.  Aspect can be given as a fraction (4/3) or
              floating point number (1.33).  Alternatively,  you  may  specify
              the exact display width and height desired.  Note that this fil-
              ter does not do any scaling itself; it just affects  what  later
              scalers (software or hardware) will do when auto-scaling to cor-
              rect aspect.

                 <w>,<h>
                      New display width and height.  Can also be these special
                      values:
                          0:   original display width and height
                         -1:   original video width and height (default)
                         -2:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original display aspect ratio.
                         -3:   Calculate w/h using the other dimension and the
                         original video aspect ratio.

                 EXAMPLE:
                           dsize=800:-2
                                  Specifies  a  display  resolution of 800x600
                                  for a 4/3 aspect video,  or  800x450  for  a
                                  16/9 aspect video.
                 <aspect-method>
                      Modifies  width  and height according to original aspect
                      ratios.
                         -1: Ignore original aspect ratio (default).
                          0: Keep display aspect ratio by using <w> and <h> as
                         maximum resolution.
                          1: Keep display aspect ratio by using <w> and <h> as
                         minimum resolution.
                          2: Keep video aspect ratio by using <w> and  <h>  as
                         maximum resolution.
                          3:  Keep  video aspect ratio by using <w> and <h> as
                         minimum resolution.

                 EXAMPLE:
                           dsize=800:600:0
                                  Specifies a display resolution  of  at  most
                                  800x600,  or  smaller,  in order to keep as-
                                  pect.

                 <r>
                      Rounds up to make both width and height divisible by <r>
                      (default: 1).

       yuy2
              Forces  software  YV12/I420/422P to YUY2 conversion.  Useful for
              video cards/drivers with slow YV12 but fast YUY2 support.

       yvu9
              Forces software YVU9 to YV12 colorspace conversion.   Deprecated
              in favor of the software scaler.

       yuvcsp
              Clamps YUV color values to the CCIR 601 range without doing real
              conversion.

       rgb2bgr[=swap]
              RGB 24/32 <-> BGR 24/32 colorspace conversion.
                 swap
                      Also perform  R <-> B swapping.

       palette
              RGB/BGR 8 -> 15/16/24/32bpp colorspace conversion using palette.

       format[=fourcc]
              Restricts  the  colorspace for the next filter without doing any
              conversion.  Use together with the scale filter for a real  con-
              version.
              NOTE: For a list of available formats see format=fmt=help.
                 <fourcc>
                      format name like rgb15, bgr24, yv12, etc (default: yuy2)

       noformat[=fourcc]
              Restricts the colorspace for the next filter without  doing  any
              conversion.   Unlike the format filter, this will allow any col-
              orspace except the one you specify.
              NOTE: For a list of available formats see noformat=fmt=help.
                 <fourcc>
                      format name like rgb15, bgr24, yv12, etc (default: yv12)

       pp[=filter1[:option1[:option2...]]/[-]filter2...] (also see -pphelp)
              Enables  the specified chain of postprocessing subfilters.  Sub-
              filters must be separated by '/' and can be disabled by prepend-
              ing  a  '-'.  Each subfilter and some options have a short and a
              long name that can be used interchangeably, i.e.  dr/dering  are
              the  same.   All  subfilters  share  common options to determine
              their scope:
                 a/autoq
                      Automatically switch the subfilter off if the CPU is too
                      slow.
                 c/chrom
                      Do chrominance filtering, too (default).
                 y/nochrom
                      Do luminance filtering only (no chrominance).
                 n/noluma
                      Do chrominance filtering only (no luminance).

              NOTE: -pphelp shows a list of available subfilters.

              Available subfilters are

                 hb/hdeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      horizontal deblocking filter
                         <difference>:  Difference  factor where higher values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                      vertical deblocking filter
                         <difference>:  Difference  factor where higher values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                         <difference>:  Difference  factor where higher values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 va/vadeblock[:difference[:flatness]]
                      accurate vertical deblocking filter
                         <difference>:  Difference  factor where higher values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 32).
                         <flatness>: Flatness  threshold  where  lower  values
                         mean more deblocking (default: 39).

                 The horizontal and vertical deblocking filters share the dif-
                 ference and flatness values so you cannot set different hori-
                 zontal and vertical thresholds.

       spp[=quality[:qp[:mode]]]
              Simple postprocessing filter that  compresses  and  decompresses
              the image at several (or - in the case of quality level 6 - all)
              shifts and averages the results.

                 <quality>
                      0-6 (default: 3)

                 <qp>
                      Force quantization parameter (default: 0,  use  QP  from
                      video).

                 <mode>
                      0: hard thresholding (default)
                      1: soft thresholding (better deringing, but blurrier)
                      4: like 0, but also use B-frames' QP (may cause flicker)
                      5: like 1, but also use B-frames' QP (may cause flicker)

       uspp[=quality[:qp]]
              Ultra  simple  &  slow postprocessing filter that compresses and
              decompresses the image at several (or - in the case  of  quality
              level  8  -  all) shifts and averages the results.  The way this
              differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &
              decodes  each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a sim-
              plified intra only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.

                      0-8 (default: 3)

                 <qp>

                 <qp>
                      Force  quantization  parameter  (default: 0, use QP from
                      video).

                 <-15-32>
                      Filter strength, lower values mean more details but also
                      more  artifacts,  while  higher  values  make  the image
                      smoother but also blurrier (default: 0 - PSNR  optimal).

                 <bframes>
                      0: do not use QP from B-frames (default)
                      1: use QP from B-frames too (may cause flicker)

       pp7[=qp[:mode]]
              Variant  of  the  spp  filter, similar to spp=6 with 7 point DCT
              where only the center sample is used after IDCT.

                 <qp>
                      Force quantization parameter (default: 0,  use  QP  from
                      video).

                 <mode>
                      0: hard thresholding
                      1: soft thresholding (better deringing, but blurrier)
                      2: medium thresholding (default, good results)

                      zontally.  You can use whitespace to make  the  equation
                      more readable.  There are a couple of constants that can
                      be used in the equation:
                         PI: the number pi
                         E: the number e
                         X / Y: the coordinates of the current sample
                         W / H: width and height of the image
                         SW / SH: width/height scale depending on the current-
                         ly  filtered  plane,  e.g.  1,1  and  0.5,0.5 for YUV
                         4:2:0.
                         p(x,y): returns the value of the  pixel  at  location
                         x/y of the current plane.

                 <width>
                      Desired  width of generated image (default: 0).  0 means

                 <height>
                      Desired height of generated image (default: 0).  0 means
                      height of input image.

                 <fps>
                      force output fps (float value) (default:  0,  autodetect
                      based on height)

       dvbscale[=aspect]
              Set  up  optimal  scaling  for  DVB cards, scaling the x axis in
              hardware and calculating the y axis scaling in software to  keep
              aspect.  Only useful together with expand and scale.

                 <aspect>
                      Control  aspect ratio, calculate as DVB_HEIGHT*ASPECTRA-
                      TIO (default: 576*4/3=768), set  it  to  576*(16/9)=1024
                      for a 16:9 TV.

       denoise3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]
              This  filter  aims to reduce image noise producing smooth images
              and making still images really still (This should  enhance  com-
              pressibility.).
                 <luma_spatial>
                      spatial luma strength (default: 4)
                 <chroma_spatial>
                      spatial chroma strength (default: 3)

                      luma temporal strength (default: 6)
                 <chroma_tmp>
                      chroma  temporal strength (default: luma_tmp*chroma_spa-
                      tial/luma_spatial)

       hqdn3d[=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp]
              High precision/quality version of the denoise3d filter.  Parame-
              ters and usage are the same.

       ow[=depth[:luma_strength[:chroma_strength]]]
              Overcomplete Wavelet denoiser.
                 <depth>
                      Larger  depth values will denoise lower frequency compo-
                      nents more, but slow down filtering (default: 8).
                 <luma_strength>

       eq[=brightness:contrast] (OBSOLETE)
              Software equalizer with interactive controls just like the hard-
              ware equalizer, for cards/drivers that do not support brightness
              and contrast controls in hardware.  Might also  be  useful  with
              MEncoder,  either  for  fixing  poorly  captured  movies, or for
              slightly reducing contrast to mask artifacts  and  get  by  with
              lower bitrates.

                      initial contrast

       eq2[=gamma:contrast:brightness:saturation:rg:gg:bg:weight]
              Alternative  software  equalizer  that  uses lookup tables (very
              slow), allowing gamma correction in addition to  simple  bright-
              ness  and  contrast  adjustment.  Note that it uses the same MMX
              optimized code as -vf eq if all gamma values are 1.0.   The  pa-
              rameters are given as floating point values.
                 <0.1-10>
                      initial gamma value (default: 1.0)
                 <-2-2>
                      initial contrast, where negative values result in a neg-
                      ative image (default: 1.0)
                 <-1-1>
                      initial brightness (default: 0.0)
                 <0-3>
                      initial saturation (default: 1.0)
                 <0.1-10>
                      gamma value for the red component (default: 1.0)
                 <0.1-10>
                      gamma value for the green component (default: 1.0)
                 <0.1-10>
                      gamma value for the blue component (default: 1.0)
                 <0-1>
                      The weight parameter can be used to reduce the effect of
                      a high gamma value on bright image areas, e.g. keep them
                      from getting overamplified and just plain white.  A val-
                      ue  of  0.0  turns the gamma correction all the way down
                      while 1.0 leaves it at its full strength (default: 1.0).

       hue[=hue:saturation]
              Software equalizer with interactive controls just like the hard-
              ware equalizer, for cards/drivers that do not  support  hue  and
              saturation controls in hardware.
                 <-180-180>
                      initial hue (default: 0.0)
                 <-100-100>
                      initial  saturation,  where  negative values result in a
                      negative chroma (default: 1.0)

       halfpack[=f]
              Convert planar YUV 4:2:0 to half-height packed  4:2:2,  downsam-
              pling luma but keeping all chroma samples.  Useful for output to
              low-resolution display devices when hardware downscaling is poor
              quality  or  is  not available.  Can also be used as a primitive
              luma-only deinterlacer with very low CPU usage.
                 <f>
                      By default, halfpack averages pairs of lines when  down-
                      sampling.  Any value different from 0 or 1 gives the de-
                      fault (averaging) behavior.
                         0: Only use even lines when downsampling.
                         1: Only use odd lines when downsampling.

       ilpack[=mode]
              When interlaced video is stored in YUV 4:2:0 formats, chroma in-
              terlacing does not line up properly due to vertical downsampling
              of the chroma channels.  This filter packs the planar 4:2:0 data
              into  YUY2  (4:2:2) format with the chroma lines in their proper
              locations, so that in any given scanline, the  luma  and  chroma
              data both come from the same field.
                 <mode>
                      Select the sampling mode.
                         0: nearest-neighbor sampling, fast but incorrect
                         1: linear interpolation (default)

       harddup
              Only useful with MEncoder.  If harddup is used when encoding, it
              will force duplicate frames to be encoded in the  output.   This
              uses  slightly  more  space, but is necessary for output to MPEG
              files or if you plan to demux and remux the video  stream  after
              encoding.   Should  be  placed  at or near the end of the filter
              chain unless you have a good reason to do otherwise.

       softskip
              Only useful with MEncoder.  Softskip moves  the  frame  skipping
              (dropping) step of encoding from before the filter chain to some
              point during the filter chain.  This allows filters  which  need
              to  see  all frames (inverse telecine, temporal denoising, etc.)
              to function properly.  Should be placed after the filters  which
              need  to  see  all frames and before any subsequent filters that
              are CPU-intensive.

       decimate[=max:hi:lo:frac]
              Drops frames that do not differ greatly from the previous  frame
              in  order  to  reduce framerate.  The main use of this filter is
              for very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g. streaming  over  dialup  mo-
              dem), but it could in theory be used for fixing movies that were
              inverse-telecined incorrectly.
                 <max>
                      Sets the maximum number of consecutive frames which  can
                      be  dropped  (if  positive), or the minimum interval be-
                      tween dropped frames (if negative).
                 <hi>,<lo>,<frac>
                      A frame is a candidate for dropping  if  no  8x8  region
                      differs  by  more  than  a threshold of <hi>, and if not
                      more than <frac> portion (1  meaning  the  whole  image)
                      differs  by  more  than  a threshold of <lo>.  Values of
                      <hi> and <lo> are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent ac-
                      tual  pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 cor-
                      responds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or  the
                      same spread out differently over the block.

       dint[=sense:level]
              The  drop-deinterlace  (dint) filter detects and drops the first
              from a set of interlaced video frames.
                 <0.0-1.0>
                      relative difference between neighboring pixels (default:
                      0.1)
                 <0.0-1.0>
                      What  part of the image has to be detected as interlaced
                      to drop the frame (default: 0.15).

       lavcdeint (OBSOLETE)
              FFmpeg deinterlacing filter, same as -vf pp=fd

       kerndeint[=thresh[:map[:order[:sharp[:twoway]]]]]
              Donald Graft's adaptive kernel deinterlacer.  Deinterlaces parts
              of a video if a configurable threshold is exceeded.
                 <0-255>
                      threshold (default: 10)
                 <map>
                         0: Ignore pixels exceeding the threshold (default).
                         1: Paint pixels exceeding the threshold white.

                 <order>
                         0: Leave fields alone (default).
                         1: Swap fields.

                 <sharp>
                         0: Disable additional sharpening (default).
                         1: Enable additional sharpening.

                 <twoway>
                         0: Disable twoway sharpening (default).
                         1: Enable twoway sharpening.

       unsharp[=l|cWxH:amount[:l|cWxH:amount]]
              unsharp mask / gaussian blur

                 l
                      Apply effect on luma component.

                 c
                      Apply effect on chroma components.

                 <width>x<height>
                      width and height of the matrix, odd sized in both direc-
                      tions (min = 3x3, max = 13x11 or  11x13,  usually  some-
                      thing between 3x3 and 7x7)

                 amount
                      Relative amount of sharpness/blur to add to the image (a
                      sane range should be -1.5-1.5).
                         <0: blur
                         >0: sharpen

       swapuv
              Swap U & V plane.

       il[=d|i][s][:[d|i][s]]
              (De)interleaves lines.  The goal of this filter is  to  add  the
              ability  to process interlaced images pre-field without deinter-
              lacing them.  You can filter your interlaced DVD and play it  on
              a  TV  without  breaking  the  interlacing.  While deinterlacing
              (with the postprocessing filter) removes interlacing permanently
              (by  smoothing,  averaging, etc) deinterleaving splits the frame
              into 2 fields (so called half  pictures),  so  you  can  process
              (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.
                 d    deinterleave (placing one above the other)
                 i    interleave
                 s    swap fields (exchange even & odd lines)

       fil[=i|d]
              (De)interleaves  lines.   This  filter is very similar to the il
              filter but much faster, the main disadvantage is  that  it  does
              not  always  work.  Especially if combined with other filters it
              may produce randomly messed up images, so be happy if  it  works
              but  do not complain if it does not for your combination of fil-
              ters.
                 d    Deinterleave fields, placing them side by side.
                 i    Interleave fields again (reversing the effect of fil=d).

       field[=n]
              Extracts  a  single  field from an interlaced image using stride
              arithmetic to avoid wasting CPU time.  The optional  argument  n
              specifies  whether to extract the even or the odd field (depend-
              ing on whether n is even or odd).

       detc[=var1=value1:var2=value2:...]
              Attempts to reverse the 'telecine' process to recover  a  clean,
              non-interlaced stream at film framerate.  This was the first and
              most primitive inverse telecine filter to be added  to  MPlayer/
              MEncoder.   It  works  by latching onto the telecine 3:2 pattern
              and following it as long as possible.  This  makes  it  suitable
              for perfectly-telecined material, even in the presence of a fair
              degree of noise, but it will fail in  the  presence  of  complex
              post-telecine  edits.   Development  on this filter is no longer
              taking place, as ivtc, pullup, and filmdint are better for  most
              applications.  The following arguments (see syntax above) may be
              used to control detc's behavior:

                 <dr>
                      Set the frame dropping mode.
                         0: Do not drop frames to maintain fixed output  fram-
                         erate (default).
                         1:  Always drop a frame when there have been no drops
                         or telecine merges in the past 5 frames.
                         2: Always maintain exact 5:4 input  to  output  frame
                         ratio.
                         NOTE: Use mode 1 or 2 with MEncoder.

                 <am>
                      Analysis mode.
                         0:  Fixed pattern with initial frame number specified
                         by <fr>.
                         1: aggressive search for telecine pattern (default)

                 <fr>
                      Set initial frame number in sequence.  0-2 are the three
                      clean progressive frames; 3 and 4 are the two interlaced
                      frames.  The default, -1, means  'not  in  telecine  se-
                      quence'.   The number specified here is the type for the
                      imaginary previous frame before the movie starts.

                 <t0>, <t1>, <t2>, <t3>
                      Threshold values to be used in certain modes.

       ivtc[=1]
              Experimental 'stateless' inverse telecine filter.   Rather  than
              trying  to  lock on to a pattern like the detc filter does, ivtc
              makes its decisions independently for  each  frame.   This  will
              give  much  better results for material that has undergone heavy
              editing after telecine was applied, but as a result it is not as
              forgiving  of noisy input, for example TV capture.  The optional
              parameter (ivtc=1) corresponds to the dr=1 option for  the  detc
              filter,  and  should be used with MEncoder but not with MPlayer.
              As with detc, you must  specify  the  correct  output  framerate
              (-ofps  24000/1001) when using MEncoder.  Further development on
              ivtc has stopped, as the pullup and filmdint filters  appear  to
              be much more accurate.

       pullup[=jl:jr:jt:jb:sb:mp]
              Third-generation  pulldown  reversal  (inverse telecine) filter,
              capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progres-
              sive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.  The pullup filter
              is designed to be much more robust than detc or ivtc, by  taking
              advantage of future context in making its decisions.  Like ivtc,
              pullup is stateless in the sense that it does not  lock  onto  a
              pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
              fields in order to  identify  matches  and  rebuild  progressive
              frames.  It is still under development, but believed to be quite
              accurate.

                 jl, jr, jt, and jb
                      These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at  the
                      left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively.
                      Left/right are in units of 8  pixels,  while  top/bottom
                      are  in  units  of  2 lines.  The default is 8 pixels on
                      each side.

                 sb (strict breaks)
                      Setting this option to 1  will  reduce  the  chances  of
                      pullup generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it
                      may also cause an  excessive  number  of  frames  to  be
                      dropped  during high motion sequences.  Conversely, set-
                      ting it to -1 will make pullup match fields more easily.
                      This  may help processing of video where there is slight
                      blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to
                      be interlaced frames in the output.

                 mp (metric plane)
                      This  option  may be set to 1 or 2 to use a chroma plane
                      instead of the luma plane for  doing  pullup's  computa-
                      tions.   This  may improve accuracy on very clean source
                      material, but more likely will decrease accuracy,  espe-
                      cially  if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any
                      grayscale video.  The main purpose of setting  mp  to  a
                      chroma  plane  is to reduce CPU load and make pullup us-
                      able in realtime on slow machines.

              NOTE: Always follow pullup with the softskip filter when  encod-
              ing to ensure that pullup is able to see each frame.  Failure to
              do so will lead to incorrect output and will usually crash,  due
              to design limitations in the codec/filter layer.

       filmdint[=options]
              Inverse telecine filter, similar to the pullup filter above.  It
              is designed to handle any pulldown pattern, including mixed soft
              and hard telecine and limited support for movies that are slowed
              down or sped up from their original framerate for TV.  Only  the
              luma  plane is used to find the frame breaks.  If a field has no
              match, it is deinterlaced with simple linear approximation.   If
              the source is MPEG-2, this must be the first filter to allow ac-
              cess to the field-flags set by the MPEG-2 decoder.  Depending on
              the  source  MPEG, you may be fine ignoring this advice, as long
              as you do not see lots of "Bottom-first field"  warnings.   With
              no  options  it does normal inverse telecine, and should be used
              together with mencoder -fps 30000/1001 -ofps  24000/1001.   When
              this  filter  is  used with MPlayer, it will result in an uneven
              framerate during playback, but it is still generally better than
              using pp=lb or no deinterlacing at all.  Multiple options can be
              specified separated by /.

                 crop=<w>:<h>:<x>:<y>
                      Just like the crop filter,  but  faster,  and  works  on
                      mixed  hard and soft telecined content as well as when y
                      is not a multiple of 4.  If x or y would  require  crop-
                      ping  fractional pixels from the chroma planes, the crop
                      area is extended.  This usually means that x and y  must
                      be even.

                 io=<ifps>:<ofps>
                      For  each  ifps input frames the filter will output ofps
                      frames.   The  ratio  of  ifps/ofps  should  match   the
                      -fps/-ofps  ratio.   This could be used to filter movies
                      that are broadcast on TV at a frame rate different  from
                      their original framerate.

                 luma_only=<n>
                      If  n  is nonzero, the chroma plane is copied unchanged.
                      This is useful for YV12 sampled TV, which  discards  one
                      of the chroma fields.

                 mmx2=<n>
                      On  x86,  if  n=1, use MMX2 optimized functions, if n=2,
                      use 3DNow!  optimized functions, otherwise, use plain C.
                      If this option is not specified, MMX2 and 3DNow! are au-
                      to-detected, use this option to override auto-detection.

                 fast=<n>
                      The  larger n will speed up the filter at the expense of
                      accuracy.  The default value is n=3.  If  n  is  odd,  a
                      frame  immediately following a frame marked with the RE-
                      PEAT_FIRST_FIELD MPEG flag is assumed to be progressive,
                      thus  filter  will  not spend any time on soft-telecined
                      MPEG-2 content.  This is the only effect of this flag if
                      MMX2 or 3DNow! is available.  Without MMX2 and 3DNow, if
                      n=0 or 1, the same calculations will be used as with n=2
                      or  3.   If  n=2 or 3, the number of luma levels used to
                      find the frame breaks is reduced from 256 to 128,  which
                      results in a faster filter without losing much accuracy.
                      If n=4 or 5, a faster, but  much  less  accurate  metric
                      will  be  used  to  find the frame breaks, which is more
                      likely to misdetect high vertical detail  as  interlaced
                      content.

                 verbose=<n>
                      If  n  is  nonzero,  print the detailed metrics for each
                      frame.  Useful for debugging.

                 dint_thres=<n>
                      Deinterlace threshold.  Used  during  de-interlacing  of
                      unmatched  frames.   Larger value means less deinterlac-
                      ing, use n=256 to  completely  turn  off  deinterlacing.
                      Default is n=8.

                 comb_thres=<n>
                      Threshold  for  comparing  a top and bottom fields.  De-
                      faults to 128.

                 diff_thres=<n>
                      Threshold to detect temporal change of a field.  Default
                      is 128.

                 sad_thres=<n>
                      Sum of Absolute Difference threshold, default is 64.

       softpulldown
              This  filter  works  only  correct with MEncoder and acts on the
              MPEG-2 flags used for soft 3:2 pulldown (soft telecine).  If you
              want  to  use  the ivtc or detc filter on movies that are partly
              soft telecined, inserting this filter before  them  should  make
              them more reliable.

       divtc[=options]
              Inverse   telecine  for  deinterlaced  video.   If  3:2-pulldown
              telecined video has lost one of the fields  or  is  deinterlaced
              using  a method that keeps one field and interpolates the other,
              the result is a juddering video that has every fourth frame  du-
              plicated.  This filter is intended to find and drop those dupli-
              cates and restore the original film framerate.  When using  this
              filter, you must specify -ofps that is 4/5 of the fps of the in-
              put file and place the softskip later in  the  filter  chain  to
              make  sure  that divtc sees all the frames.  Two different modes
              are available: One pass mode is the default and is  straightfor-
              ward  to  use,  but has the disadvantage that any changes in the
              telecine phase (lost frames or bad edits) cause momentary judder
              until the filter can resync again.  Two pass mode avoids this by
              analyzing the whole video beforehand so  it  will  have  forward
              knowledge  about  the  phase changes and can resync at the exact
              spot.  These passes do not correspond to pass one and two of the
              encoding  process.   You must run an extra pass using divtc pass
              one before the actual  encoding  throwing  the  resulting  video
              away.   Use  -nosound -ovc raw -o /dev/null to avoid wasting CPU
              power for this pass.  You may add  something  like  crop=2:2:0:0
              after  divtc  to speed things up even more.  Then use divtc pass
              two for the actual encoding.  If you use multiple encoder  pass-
              es, use divtc pass two for all of them.  The options are:

                 pass=1|2
                      Use two pass mode.

                 file=<filename>
                      Set   the  two  pass  log  filename  (default:  "framed-
                      iff.log").

                 threshold=<value>
                      Set the minimum strength the telecine pattern must  have
                      for the filter to believe in it (default: 0.5).  This is
                      used to avoid recognizing false pattern from  the  parts
                      of the video that are very dark or very still.

                 window=<numframes>
                      Set  the number of past frames to look at when searching
                      for pattern (default: 30).  Longer window  improves  the
                      reliability  of  the  pattern search, but shorter window
                      improves  the  reaction  time  to  the  changes  in  the
                      telecine  phase.   This  only affects the one pass mode.
                      The two pass mode currently uses fixed window  that  ex-
                      tends to both future and past.

                 phase=0|1|2|3|4
                      Sets  the  initial telecine phase for one pass mode (de-
                      fault: 0).  The two pass mode can see the future, so  it
                      is able to use the correct phase from the beginning, but
                      one pass mode can only guess.  It  catches  the  correct
                      phase  when  it finds it, but this option can be used to
                      fix the possible juddering at the beginning.  The  first
                      pass of the two pass mode also uses this, so if you save
                      the output from the first pass, you get  constant  phase
                      result.

                 deghost=<value>
                      Set  the  deghosting threshold (0-255 for one pass mode,
                      -255-255 for two pass mode,  default  0).   If  nonzero,
                      deghosting  mode  is  used.   This is for video that has
                      been deinterlaced by blending the  fields  together  in-
                      stead  of dropping one of the fields.  Deghosting ampli-
                      fies any compression artifacts in the blended frames, so
                      the  parameter  value  is used as a threshold to exclude
                      those pixels from deghosting that differ from the previ-
                      ous  frame  less than specified value.  If two pass mode
                      is used, then negative value can be  used  to  make  the
                      filter  analyze  the  whole  video  in  the beginning of
                      pass-2 to determine whether it needs deghosting  or  not
                      and then select either zero or the absolute value of the
                      parameter.  Specify this option for pass-2, it makes  no
                      difference on pass-1.

       phase[=t|b|p|a|u|T|B|A|U][:v]
              Delay interlaced video by one field time so that the field order
              changes.  The intended use is to fix PAL movies that  have  been
              captured  with  the  opposite  field  order to the film-to-video
              transfer.  The options are:

                 t    Capture field order  top-first,  transfer  bottom-first.
                      Filter will delay the bottom field.

                 b    Capture  bottom-first,  transfer top-first.  Filter will
                      delay the top field.

                 p    Capture and transfer with the same  field  order.   This
                      mode  only exists for the documentation of the other op-
                      tions to refer to, but if you actually  select  it,  the
                      filter will faithfully do nothing ;-)

                 a    Capture  field  order  determined automatically by field
                      flags, transfer opposite.  Filter selects among t and  b
                      modes  on  a frame by frame basis using field flags.  If
                      no field information is available, then this works  just
                      like u.

                 u    Capture  unknown  or varying, transfer opposite.  Filter
                      selects among t and b on a frame by frame basis by  ana-
                      lyzing  the  images  and  selecting the alternative that
                      produces best match between the fields.

                 T    Capture top-first, transfer unknown or varying.   Filter
                      selects among t and p using image analysis.

                 B    Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Fil-
                      ter selects among b and p using image analysis.

                 A    Capture determined by field flags, transfer  unknown  or
                      varying.   Filter  selects  among t, b and p using field
                      flags and image analysis.  If no  field  information  is
                      available, then this works just like U.  This is the de-
                      fault mode.

                 U    Both capture and transfer unknown  or  varying.   Filter
                      selects among t, b and p using image analysis only.

                 v    Verbose  operation.   Prints  the selected mode for each
                      frame and the average squared difference between  fields
                      for t, b, and p alternatives.

       telecine[=start]
              Apply 3:2 'telecine' process to increase framerate by 20%.  This
              most likely will not work correctly with MPlayer, but it can  be
              used   with  'mencoder  -fps  30000/1001  -ofps  30000/1001  -vf
              telecine'.  Both fps options  are  essential!   (A/V  sync  will
              break  if  they  are wrong.)  The optional start parameter tells
              the filter where in the telecine pattern to start (0-3).

       tinterlace[=mode]
              Temporal field interlacing - merge pairs of frames into  an  in-
              terlaced  frame,  halving  the framerate.  Even frames are moved
              into the upper field, odd frames to the lower field.   This  can
              be  used  to  fully reverse the effect of the tfields filter (in
              mode 0).  Available modes are:
                 0    Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the low-
                      er field, generating a full-height frame at half framer-
                      ate.
                 1    Only output odd frames, even frames are dropped;  height
                      unchanged.
                 2    Only  output even frames, odd frames are dropped; height
                      unchanged.
                 3    Expand each frame to  full  height,  but  pad  alternate
                      lines with black; framerate unchanged.
                 4    Interleave  even  lines  from even frames with odd lines
                      from odd frames.  Height unchanged at half framerate.

       tfields[=mode[:field_dominance]]
              Temporal field separation - split fields into  frames,  doubling
              the  output  framerate.   Like the telecine filter, tfields will
              only work properly with MEncoder, and only if both -fps and -of-
              ps are set to the desired (double) framerate!
                 <mode>
                      0: Leave fields unchanged (will jump/flicker).
                      1:  Interpolate missing lines. (The algorithm used might
                      not be so good.)
                      2: Translate fields by 1/4 pixel with linear  interpola-
                      tion (no jump).
                      4: Translate fields by 1/4 pixel with 4tap filter (high-
                      er quality) (default).
                 <field_dominance> (DEPRECATED)
                      -1: auto (default) Only works if the decoder exports the
                      appropriate  information and no other filters which dis-
                      card that information come before tfields in the  filter
                      chain, otherwise it falls back to 0 (top field first).
                      0: top field first
                      1: bottom field first
                      NOTE:  This  option will possibly be removed in a future
                      version.  Use -field-dominance instead.

       yadif=[mode[:field_dominance]]
              Yet another deinterlacing filter
                 <mode>
                      0: Output 1 frame for each frame.
                      1: Output 1 frame for each field.
                      2: Like 0 but skips spatial interlacing check.
                      3: Like 1 but skips spatial interlacing check.
                 <field_dominance> (DEPRECATED)
                      Operates like tfields.
                      NOTE: This option will possibly be removed in  a  future
                      version.  Use -field-dominance instead.

       mcdeint=[mode[:parity[:qp]]]
              Motion  compensating deinterlacer.  It needs one field per frame
              as input and must  thus  be  used  together  with  tfields=1  or
              yadif=1/3 or equivalent.
                 <mode>
                      0: fast
                      1: medium
                      2: slow, iterative motion estimation
                      3: extra slow, like 2 plus multiple reference frames
                 <parity>
                      0  or  1 selects which field to use (note: no autodetec-
                      tion yet!).
                 <qp>
                      Higher values should result in a smoother motion  vector
                      field but less optimal individual vectors.

       bmovl=hidden:opaque:fifo
              The bitmap overlay filter reads bitmaps from a FIFO and displays
              them on top of the movie, allowing some transformations  on  the
              image.   Also see TOOLS/bmovl-test.c for a small bmovl test pro-

                      Clear area.
                 OPAQUE
                      Disable  all alpha transparency.  Send "ALPHA 0 0 0 0 0"
                      to enable it again.
                 HIDE
                      Hide bitmap.
                 SHOW
                      Show bitmap.

              Arguments are:
                 <width>, <height>
                      image/area size
                 <xpos>, <ypos>
                      Start blitting at position x/y.
                 <alpha>
                      Set alpha difference.  If you set this to -255  you  can
                      then  send  a sequence of ALPHA-commands to set the area
                      to -225, -200, -175 etc for a nice fade-in-effect! ;)
                         0:    same as original
                         255:  Make everything opaque.
                         -255: Make everything transparent.

                 <clear>
                      Clear the framebuffer before blitting.
                         0: The image will just be blitted on top of  the  old
                         one,  so you do not need to send 1.8MB of RGBA32 data
                         every time a small part of the screen is updated.
                         1: clear

       framestep=I|[i]step
              Renders only every nth frame or every intra frame (keyframe).

              If you call the filter with I (uppercase) as the parameter, then
              only keyframes are rendered.  For DVDs it generally means one in
              every 15/12 frames (IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB), for  AVI  it  means  every
              scene  change or every keyint value (see -lavcopts keyint= value
              if you use MEncoder to encode the video).

              When a keyframe is found, an 'I!' string followed by  a  newline
              character  is  printed, leaving the current line of MPlayer/MEn-
              coder output on the screen, because it  contains  the  time  (in
              seconds)  and frame number of the keyframe (You can use this in-
              formation to split the AVI.).

              If you call the filter with a numeric parameter 'step' then only
              one in every 'step' frames is rendered.

              If  you put an 'i' (lowercase) before the number then an 'I!' is
              printed (like the I parameter).

              If you give only the i then nothing is done to the frames,  only
              I! is printed.

       tile=xtiles:ytiles:output:start:delta
              Tile  a  series  of  images into a single, bigger image.  If you
              omit a parameter or use a value less than 0,  then  the  default
              value  is  used.   You can also stop when you are satisfied (...
              -vf tile=10:5 ...).  It is probably a good idea to put the scale
              filter before the tile :-)

              The parameters are:

                 <xtiles>
                      number of tiles on the x axis (default: 5)
                 <ytiles>
                      number of tiles on the y axis (default: 5)
                 <output>
                      Render  the  tile  when  'output'  number  of frames are
                      reached, where 'output' should be  a  number  less  than
                      xtile  *  ytile.   Missing  tiles  are  left blank.  You
                      could, for example, write an 8 * 7 tile every 50  frames
                      to have one image every 2 seconds @ 25 fps.
                 <start>
                      outer border thickness in pixels (default: 2)
                 <delta>
                      inner border thickness in pixels (default: 4)

       delogo[=x:y:w:h:t]
              Suppresses  a  TV  station logo by a simple interpolation of the
              surrounding pixels.  Just set a rectangle covering the logo  and
              watch it disappear (and sometimes something even uglier appear -
              your mileage may vary).
                 <x>,<y>
                      top left corner of the logo
                 <w>,<h>
                      width and height of the cleared rectangle
                 <t>  Thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to w
                      and  h).   When set to -1, a green rectangle is drawn on
                      the screen to simplify finding the right x,y,w,h parame-
                      ters.

       remove-logo=/path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
              Suppresses  a  TV station logo, using a PGM or PPM image file to
              determine which pixels comprise the logo.  The width and  height
              of  the  image  file  must match those of the video stream being
              processed.  Uses the filter image and a circular blur  algorithm
              to remove the logo.

                 /path/to/logo_bitmap_file_name.pgm
                      [path] + filename of the filter image.

       zrmjpeg[=options]
              Software YV12 to MJPEG encoder for use with the zr2 video output
              device.

                 maxheight=<h>|maxwidth=<w>
                      These options set the maximum width and  height  the  zr
                      card can handle (the MPlayer filter layer currently can-
                      not query those).

                 {dc10+,dc10,buz,lml33}-{PAL|NTSC}
                      Use these options to set maxwidth and maxheight automat-
                      ically to the values known for card/mode combo.  For ex-
                      ample, valid options are:  dc10-PAL  and  buz-NTSC  (de-
                      fault: dc10+PAL)

                 color|bw
                      Select  color  or  black  and white encoding.  Black and
                      white encoding is faster.  Color is the default.

                 hdec={1,2,4}
                      Horizontal decimation 1, 2 or 4.

                 vdec={1,2,4}
                      Vertical decimation 1, 2 or 4.

                 quality=1-20
                      Set JPEG compression quality [BEST] 1 - 20 [VERY BAD].

                 fd|nofd
                      By default, decimation is only performed  if  the  Zoran
                      hardware  can  upscale the resulting MJPEG images to the
                      original size.  The option fd instructs  the  filter  to
                      always perform the requested decimation (ugly).

       screenshot
              Allows  acquiring screenshots of the movie using slave mode com-
              mands that can be bound to keypresses.  See the slave mode docu-
              mentation  and  the  INTERACTIVE  CONTROL  section  for details.
              Files named 'shotNNNN.png' will be saved in the working directo-
              ry,  using  the  first available number - no files will be over-
              written.  The filter has no overhead when not used  and  accepts
              an arbitrary colorspace, so it is safe to add it to the configu-
              ration file.  Make sure that the screenshot filter is added  af-
              ter  all  other  filters  whose effect you want to record on the
              saved image.  E.g. it should be the last filter if you  want  to
              have an exact screenshot of what you see on the monitor.

       ass
              Moves  SSA/ASS  subtitle  rendering to an arbitrary point in the
              filter chain.  Only useful with the -ass option.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -vf ass,screenshot
                      Moves SSA/ASS rendering before  the  screenshot  filter.
                      Screenshots taken this way will contain subtitles.

       blackframe[=amount:threshold]
              Detect frames that are (almost) completely black.  Can be useful
              to detect chapter transitions or commercials.  Output lines con-
              sist  of  the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage
              of blackness, the frame type and the frame number  of  the  last
              encountered keyframe.

                 <amount>
                      Percentage  of  the  pixels  that  have  to be below the
                      threshold (default: 98).

                 <threshold>
                      Threshold below which a pixel value is considered  black
                      (default: 32).

       gradfun[=strength[:radius]]
              Fix  the  banding  artifacts  that are sometimes introduced into
              nearly flat regions by truncation to 8bit colordepth.   Interpo-
              lates  the  gradients  that  should  go where the bands are, and
              dithers them.

              This filter is designed for playback only.  Do not use it  prior
              to  lossy  compression,  because  compression  tends to lose the
              dither and bring back the bands.

                 <strength>
                      Maximum amount by which the filter will change  any  one
                      pixel.  Also the threshold for detecting nearly flat re-
                      gions (default: 1.2).

                 <radius>
                      Neighborhood to fit  the  gradient  to.   Larger  radius
                      makes for smoother gradients, but also prevents the fil-
                      ter from modifying pixels  near  detailed  regions  (de-
                      fault: 16).

GENERAL ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
       -audio-delay <any floating-point number>
              Delays  either  audio  or  video by setting a delay field in the
              header (default: 0.0).  This does not delay either stream  while
              encoding, but the player will see the delay field and compensate
              accordingly.  Positive values delay the audio, and negative val-
              ues  delay  the  video.  Note that this is the exact opposite of
              the -delay option.  For example, if a video plays correctly with
              -delay  0.2,  you  can fix the video with MEncoder by using -au-
              dio-delay -0.2.

              Currently, this option only works with the  default  muxer  (-of
              avi).   If  you  are  using a different muxer, then you must use
              -delay instead.

       -audio-density <1-50>
              Number of audio chunks per second (default is 2  for  0.5s  long
              audio chunks).
              NOTE: CBR only, VBR ignores this as it puts each packet in a new
              chunk.

       -audio-preload <0.0-2.0>
              Sets up the audio buffering time interval (default: 0.5s).

       -fafmttag <format>
              Can be used to override the audio format tag of the output file.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -fafmttag 0x55
                      Will  have  the  output file contain 0x55 (mp3) as audio
                      format tag.

       -ffourcc <fourcc>
              Can be used to override the video fourcc of the output file.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ffourcc div3
                      Will have the output file contain 'div3' as video  four-
                      cc.

       -force-avi-aspect <0.2-3.0>
              Override the aspect stored in the AVI OpenDML vprp header.  This
              can be used to change the aspect ratio with '-ovc copy'.

       -frameno-file <filename> (DEPRECATED)
              Specify the name of the audio  file  with  framenumber  mappings
              created  in  the first (audio only) pass of a special three pass
              encoding mode.
              NOTE: Using this mode will most likely give you A-V desync.   Do
              not  use  it.   It  is kept for backwards compatibility only and
              will possibly be removed in a future version.

       -hr-edl-seek
              Use a more precise, but much slower method for  skipping  areas.
              Areas  marked  for  skipping  are  not  seeked over, instead all
              frames are decoded, but only the necessary frames  are  encoded.
              This allows starting at non-keyframe boundaries.
              NOTE: Not guaranteed to work right with '-ovc copy'.

       -info <option1:option2:...> (AVI only)
              Specify the info header of the resulting AVI file.

              Available options are:

       -noautoexpand
              Do  not automatically insert the expand filter into the MEncoder
              filter chain.  Useful to control at which point  of  the  filter
              chain  subtitles  are  rendered when hardcoding subtitles onto a
              movie.

       -noencodedups
              Do not attempt to encode duplicate frames in  duplicate;  always
              output  zero-byte  frames  to  indicate  duplicates.   Zero-byte
              frames will be written anyway unless a filter or encoder capable
              of  doing duplicate encoding is loaded.  Currently the only such
              filter is harddup.

       -noodml (-of avi only)
              Do not write OpenDML index for AVI files >1GB.

       -noskip
              Do not skip frames.

       -o <filename>
              Outputs to the given filename.
              If you want a default output filename, you can put  this  option
              in the MEncoder config file.

       -oac <codec name>
              Encode with the given audio codec (no default set).
              NOTE: Use -oac help to get a list of available audio codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -oac copy
                      no encoding, just streamcopy
                 -oac pcm
                      Encode to uncompressed PCM.
                 -oac mp3lame
                      Encode to MP3 (using LAME).
                 -oac lavc
                      Encode with a libavcodec codec.

       -of <format> (BETA CODE!)
              Encode to the specified container format (default: AVI).
              NOTE: Use -of help to get a list of available container formats.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -of avi
                      Encode to AVI.
                 -of mpeg
                      Encode to MPEG (also see -mpegopts).
                 -of lavf
                      Encode with libavformat muxers (also see -lavfopts).
                 -of rawvideo
                      raw video stream (no muxing - one video stream only)
                 -of rawaudio
                      raw audio stream (no muxing - one audio stream only)

       -ofps <fps>
              Specify a frames per second (fps) value  for  the  output  file,
              which  can  be different from that of the source material.  Must
              be  set  for  variable  fps  (ASF,  some  MOV)  and  progressive
              (30000/1001 fps telecined MPEG) files.

       -ovc <codec name>
              Encode with the given video codec (no default set).
              NOTE: Use -ovc help to get a list of available video codecs.

              EXAMPLE:
                 -ovc copy
                      no encoding, just streamcopy
                 -ovc raw
                      Encode  to  an  arbitrary  uncompressed format (use '-vf
                      format' to select).
                 -ovc lavc
                      Encode with a libavcodec codec.

       -passlogfile <filename>
              Dump first pass information to <filename> instead of the default
              divx2pass.log in two pass encoding mode.

       -skiplimit <value>
              Specify  the  maximum number of frames that may be skipped after
              encoding one frame (-noskiplimit for unlimited).

       -vobsubout <basename>
              Specify the basename for the output .idx and .sub  files.   This
              turns off subtitle rendering in the encoded movie and diverts it
              to VOBsub subtitle files.

       -vobsuboutid <langid>
              Specify the language two letter code for  the  subtitles.   This
              overrides what is read from the DVD or the .ifo file.

       -vobsuboutindex <index>
              Specify the index of the subtitles in the output files (default:
              0).

CODEC SPECIFIC ENCODING OPTIONS (MENCODER ONLY)
       You can specify codec specific encoding parameters using the  following
       syntax:

       -<codec>opts <option1[=value1]:option2[=value2]:...>

       Where  <codec>  may  be: lavc, xvidenc, mp3lame, toolame, twolame, nuv,
       xvfw, faac, x264enc, mpeg, lavf.

       br=<32-384>
              In  CBR  mode this parameter indicates the bitrate in kbps, when
              in VBR mode it is the minimum bitrate allowed  per  frame.   VBR
              mode will not work with a value below 112.

       vbr=<-50-50> (VBR only)
              variability  range;  if  negative the encoder shifts the average
              bitrate towards the lower limit, if positive towards the higher.
              When set to 0 CBR is used (default).

       maxvbr=<32-384> (VBR only)
              maximum bitrate allowed per frame, in kbps

              Enables temporal noise shaping.

       cutoff=<0-sampling_rate/2>
              cutoff frequency (default: sampling_rate/2)

       raw
              Stores the bitstream as raw payload with extradata in  the  con-
              tainer  header  (default:  0,  corresponds to ADTS).  Do not set
              this flag if not explicitly required or you will not be able  to
              remux the audio stream later on.

   lavc (-lavcopts)
       Many  libavcodec (lavc for short) options are tersely documented.  Read
       the source for full details.

       EXAMPLE:
                 vcodec=msmpeg4:vbitrate=1800:vhq:keyint=250

       o=<key>=<value>[,<key>=<value>[,...]]
              Pass AVOptions to libavcodec encoder.  Note, a patch to make the
              o=  unneeded  and  pass all unknown options through the AVOption
              system is welcome.  A full list of AVOptions can be found in the
              FFmpeg  manual.  Note that some AVOptions may conflict with MEn-
              coder options.

              Use the specified Windows audio format tag (e.g. atag=0x55).

       bit_exact
              Use  only  bit  exact  algorithms (except (I)DCT).  Additionally
              bit_exact disables several optimizations and thus should only be
              used  for  regression  tests,  which need binary identical files
              even if the encoder version changes.  This also  suppresses  the
              user_data  header in MPEG-4 streams.  Do not use this option un-
              less you know exactly what you are doing.

       threads=<1-8>
              Maximum number of threads to  use  (default:  1).   May  have  a
              slight negative effect on motion estimation.

       vqmin=<1-31>
              minimum quantizer

                 1    Not  recommended  (much larger file, little quality dif-
                      ference and weird side effects: msmpeg4,  h263  will  be
                      very low quality, ratecontrol will be confused resulting
                      in lower quality and some decoders will not be  able  to
                      decode it).

                 2    Recommended  for  normal  mpeg4/mpeg1video encoding (de-
                      fault).

                 3    Recommended for h263(p)/msmpeg4.  The reason for prefer-
                      ring  3 over 2 is that 2 could lead to overflows.  (This
                      will be fixed for h263(p) by changing the quantizer  per
                      MB in the future, msmpeg4 cannot be fixed as it does not
                      support that.)

       lmin=<0.01-255.0>
              Minimum frame-level Lagrange  multiplier  for  ratecontrol  (de-
              fault: 2.0).  Lavc will rarely use quantizers below the value of
              lmin.  Lowering lmin will make lavc more likely to choose  lower
              quantizers  for  some  frames,  but  not lower than the value of
              vqmin.  Likewise, raising lmin will make  lavc  less  likely  to
              choose  low  quantizers,  even if vqmin would have allowed them.
              You probably want to set  lmin  approximately  equal  to  vqmin.
              When  adaptive  quantization  is  in use, changing lmin/lmax may
              have less of an effect; see mblmin/mblmax.

       lmax=<0.01-255.0>
              maximum Lagrange multiplier for ratecontrol (default: 31.0)

       mblmin=<0.01-255.0>
              Minimum macroblock-level  Lagrange  multiplier  for  ratecontrol
              (default:2.0).  This parameter affects adaptive quantization op-
              tions like qprd, lumi_mask, etc..

       mblmax=<0.01-255.0>
              Maximum macroblock-level  Lagrange  multiplier  for  ratecontrol
              (default: 31.0).

       vqscale=<0-31>
              Constant  quantizer  / constant  quality encoding (selects fixed
              quantizer mode).  A lower value means better quality but  larger
              files (default: -1).  In case of snow codec, value 0 means loss-
              less encoding.  Since the other codecs do not support this, vqs-
              cale=0 will have an undefined effect.  1 is not recommended (see
              vqmin for details).

       vqmax=<1-31>
              Maximum quantizer, 10-31 should be a sane range (default: 31).

       mbqmin=<1-31>
              obsolete, use vqmin

       mbqmax=<1-31>
              obsolete, use vqmax

       vqdiff=<1-31>
              maximum quantizer difference between consecutive I- or  P-frames
              (default: 3)

       vmax_b_frames=<0-4>
              maximum number of B-frames between non-B-frames:
                 0    no B-frames (default)
                 0-2  sane range for MPEG-4

       vme=<0-5>
              motion estimation method.  Available methods are:
                 0    none (very low quality)
                 1    full (slow, currently unmaintained and disabled)
                 2    log (low quality, currently unmaintained and disabled)
                 3    phods (low quality, currently unmaintained and disabled)
                 4    EPZS: size=1 diamond, size can be adjusted with the *dia
                      options (default)
                 5    X1 (experimental, currently aliased to EPZS)
                 8    iter (iterative overlapped block, only used in snow)

              NOTE: 0-3 currently ignores the amount of bits spent, so quality
              may be low.

       me_range=<0-9999>
              motion estimation search range (default: 0 (unlimited))

       mbd=<0-2> (also see *cmp, qpel)
              Macroblock decision algorithm (high quality mode),  encode  each
              macro  block in all modes and choose the best.  This is slow but
              results in better quality and file size.  When mbd is set  to  1
              or  2,  the value of mbcmp is ignored when comparing macroblocks
              (the mbcmp value is still used in other places though,  in  par-
              ticular  the  motion search algorithms).  If any comparison set-
              ting (precmp, subcmp, cmp, or  mbcmp)  is  nonzero,  however,  a
              slower  but  better half-pel motion search will be used, regard-
              less of what mbd is set to.  If qpel is set, quarter-pel  motion
              search will be used regardless.
                 0    Use comparison function given by mbcmp (default).
                 1    Select the MB mode which needs the fewest bits (=vhq).
                 2    Select the MB mode which has the best rate distortion.

       vhq
              Same as mbd=1, kept for compatibility reasons.

       v4mv
              Allow 4 motion vectors per macroblock (slightly better quality).
              Works better if used with mbd>0.

       obmc
              overlapped block motion compensation (H.263+)

       loop
              loop filter (H.263+) note, this is broken

       inter_threshold <-1000-1000>
              Does absolutely nothing at the moment.

       keyint=<0-300>
              maximum interval between keyframes in frames  (default:  250  or
              one  keyframe  every  ten seconds in a 25fps movie.  This is the
              recommended default for MPEG-4).  Most  codecs  require  regular
              keyframes  in order to limit the accumulation of mismatch error.
              Keyframes are also needed for seeking, as seeking is only possi-
              ble  to  a  keyframe  - but keyframes need more space than other
              frames, so larger numbers here mean slightly smaller  files  but
              less  precise  seeking.  0 is equivalent to 1, which makes every
              frame a keyframe.  Values >300 are not recommended as the quali-
              ty might be bad depending upon decoder, encoder and luck.  It is
              common for MPEG-1/2 to use values <=30.

       sc_threshold=<-1000000000-1000000000>
              Threshold for scene change detection.  A keyframe is inserted by
              libavcodec  when it detects a scene change.  You can specify the
              sensitivity of the  detection  with  this  option.   -1000000000
              means   there  is  a  scene  change  detected  at  every  frame,
              1000000000 means no scene changes are detected (default: 0).

       sc_factor=<any positive integer>
              Causes frames with higher quantizers to be more likely to  trig-
              ger  a scene change detection and make libavcodec use an I-frame
              (default: 1).  1-16 is a sane range.  Values between 2 and 6 may
              yield  increasing  PSNR (up to approximately 0.04 dB) and better
              placement of I-frames in high-motion scenes.  Higher values than
              6 may give very slightly better PSNR (approximately 0.01 dB more
              than sc_factor=6), but noticably worse visual quality.

       vb_strategy=<0-2> (pass one only)
              strategy to choose between I/P/B-frames:
                 0    Always use the maximum number of B-frames (default).
                 1    Avoid B-frames in high motion scenes.  See the  b_sensi-
                      tivity option to tune this strategy.
                 2    Places  B-frames more or less optimally to yield maximum
                      quality (slower).  You may want to reduce the speed  im-
                      pact of this option by tuning the option brd_scale.

       b_sensitivity=<any integer greater than 0>
              Adjusts  how sensitively vb_strategy=1 detects motion and avoids
              using B-frames (default: 40).  Lower sensitivities  will  result
              in  more  B-frames.   Using more B-frames usually improves PSNR,
              but too many B-frames can hurt quality  in  high-motion  scenes.
              Unless there is an extremely high amount of motion, b_sensitivi-
              ty can safely be lowered below the default; 10 is  a  reasonable
              value in most cases.

       brd_scale=<0-10>
              Downscales  frames  for  dynamic  B-frame decision (default: 0).
              Each time brd_scale is increased by one,  the  frame  dimensions
              are  divided  by  two, which improves speed by a factor of four.
              Both dimensions of the fully downscaled frame must be even  num-
              bers, so brd_scale=1 requires the original dimensions to be mul-
              tiples of four, brd_scale=2 requires multiples  of  eight,  etc.
              In  other  words, the dimensions of the original frame must both
              be divisible by 2^(brd_scale+1) with no remainder.

       bidir_refine=<0-4>
              Refine the two motion vectors used in bidirectional macroblocks,
              rather  than  re-using  vectors  from  the  forward and backward
              searches.  This option has no effect without B-frames.
                 0    Disabled (default).
                 1-4  Use a wider search (larger values are slower).

       vpass=<1-3>
              Activates internal two (or more) pass mode, only specify if  you
              wish to use two (or more) pass encoding.
                 1    first pass (also see turbo)
                 2    second pass
                 3    Nth  pass (second and subsequent passes of N-pass encod-
                      ing)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The first pass (vpass=1) writes the statistics file.  You  might
              want  to  deactivate  some CPU-hungry options, like "turbo" mode
              does.
              In two pass mode, the second pass (vpass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In  N-pass  mode,  the second pass (vpass=3, that is not a typo)
              does both: It first reads the statistics, then overwrites  them.
              You  might  want  to  backup  divx2pass.log before doing this if
              there is any possibility that you will have to cancel  MEncoder.
              You can use all encoding options, except very CPU-hungry options
              like "qns".
              You can run this same pass over and over to refine  the  encode.
              Each  subsequent  pass will use the statistics from the previous
              pass to improve.  The final pass can include any CPU-hungry  en-
              coding options.
              If  you  want  a  2  pass  encode,  use  first vpass=1, and then
              vpass=2.
              If you want a 3 or more pass encode, use vpass=1 for  the  first
              pass and then vpass=3 and then vpass=3 again and again until you
              are satisfied with the encode.

              huffyuv:
                 pass 1
                      Saves statistics.
                 pass 2
                      Encodes with an optimal Huffman table based upon statis-
                      tics from the first pass.

       turbo (two pass only)
              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and dis-
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will probably reduce  global
              PSNR  a  little  bit (around 0.01dB) and change individual frame
              type and PSNR a little bit more (up to 0.03dB).

       aspect=<x/y>
              Store movie aspect internally, just like with MPEG files.   Much
              nicer  than  rescaling,  because quality is not decreased.  Only
              MPlayer will play these files correctly, other players will dis-
              play  them with wrong aspect.  The aspect parameter can be given
              as a ratio or a floating point number.

              EXAMPLE:
                 aspect=16/9 or aspect=1.78

       autoaspect
              Same as the aspect option, but  automatically  computes  aspect,
              taking into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.)
              made in the filter chain.  Does not incur a performance penalty,
              so you can safely leave it always on.

       vbitrate=<value>

              range.  (warning: 1kbit = 1000 bits) (default: 8000)
              NOTE: vratetol should not be too large during the second pass or
              there might be problems if vrc_(min|max)rate is used.

       vdpart
              Data  partitioning.  Adds 2 Bytes per video packet, improves er-
              ror-resistance when transferring over unreliable channels  (e.g.
              streaming over the internet).  Each video packet will be encoded
              in 3 separate partitions:
                 1. MVs
                      movement
                 2. DC coefficients
                      low res picture
                 3. AC coefficients
                      details
              MV & DC are most important, losing them  looks  far  worse  than
              losing  the  AC  and  the  1. & 2. partition.  (MV & DC) are far
              smaller than the 3. partition (AC) meaning that errors will  hit
              the  AC  partition  much more often than the MV & DC partitions.
              Thus, the picture will look better with partitioning than  with-
              out, as without partitioning an error will trash AC/DC/MV equal-
              ly.

       lumi_mask=<0.0-1.0>
              Luminance masking is a 'psychosensory' setting that is  supposed
              to make use of the fact that the human eye tends to notice fewer
              details in very bright parts of the picture.  Luminance  masking
              compresses  bright  areas  stronger than medium ones, so it will
              save bits that can be spent again on other frames, raising over-
              all subjective quality, while possibly reducing PSNR.
              WARNING:  Be  careful,  overly large values can cause disastrous
              things.
              WARNING: Large values might look good on some monitors  but  may
              look horrible on other monitors.

              Darkness  masking  is a 'psychosensory' setting that is supposed
              to make use of the fact that the human eye tends to notice fewer
              details  in  very  dark  parts of the picture.  Darkness masking
              compresses dark areas stronger than medium ones, so it will save

       tcplx_mask=<0.0-1.0>
              Temporal complexity masking (default: 0.0 (disabled)).   Imagine
              a  scene  with  a bird flying across the whole scene; tcplx_mask
              will raise the quantizers of the bird's  macroblocks  (thus  de-
              creasing  their quality), as the human eye usually does not have
              time to see all the bird's  details.   Be  warned  that  if  the
              masked  object  stops (e.g. the bird lands) it is likely to look
              horrible for a short period of time, until the  encoder  figures
              out that the object is not moving and needs refined blocks.  The
              saved bits will be spent on other parts of the video, which  may
              increase  subjective  quality, provided that tcplx_mask is care-
              fully chosen.

       scplx_mask=<0.0-1.0>
              Spatial complexity masking.  Larger values help against  blocki-
              ness,  if  no  deblocking  filter is used for decoding, which is
              maybe not a good idea.
              Imagine a scene with grass (which usually has great spatial com-
              plexity),  a  blue  sky  and  a house; scplx_mask will raise the
              quantizers of the grass' macroblocks, thus decreasing its quali-
              ty, in order to spend more bits on the sky and the house.
              HINT:  Crop any black borders completely as they will reduce the
              quality of the macroblocks (also applies without scplx_mask).
                 0.0

                 0.0-0.5
                      sane range

              NOTE: This setting does not have the same effect as using a cus-
              tom  matrix  that would compress high frequencies harder, as sc-
              plx_mask will reduce the quality of P blocks even if only DC  is
              changing.   The  result  of scplx_mask will probably not look as
              good.

       p_mask=<0.0-1.0> (also see vi_qfactor)
              Reduces the quality of inter blocks.  This is equivalent to  in-
              creasing  the  quality of intra blocks, because the same average
              bitrate will be distributed by the rate controller to the  whole
              video  sequence  (default:  0.0 (disabled)).  p_mask=1.0 doubles
              the bits allocated to each intra block.

       border_mask=<0.0-1.0>
              border-processing for MPEG-style  encoders.   Border  processing
              increases  the  quantizer  for  macroblocks  which are less than
              1/5th of the frame width/height  away  from  the  frame  border,
              since they are often visually less important.

       naq
              Normalize  adaptive  quantization  (experimental).   When  using
              adaptive quantization (*_mask), the average per-MB quantizer may
              no  longer  match the requested frame-level quantizer.  Naq will
              attempt to adjust the per-MB quantizers to maintain  the  proper
              average.

              sult in more noise.  0 NSSE is identical to  SSE  You  may  find
              this  useful  if  you  prefer to keep some noise in your encoded
              video rather than filtering it away  before  encoding  (default:
              8).

       predia=<-99-6>
              diamond type and size for motion estimation pre-pass

       dia=<-99-6>
              Diamond  type & size for motion estimation.  Motion search is an
              iterative process.  Using a small diamond  does  not  limit  the
              search  to  finding only small motion vectors.  It is just some-
              what more likely to stop before finding  the  very  best  motion
              vector,  especially when noise is involved.  Bigger diamonds al-
              low a wider search for the best motion vector, thus  are  slower
              but result in better quality.
              Big  normal diamonds are better quality than shape-adaptive dia-
              monds.
              Shape-adaptive diamonds are a good tradeoff  between  speed  and
              quality.
              NOTE:  The  sizes of the normal diamonds and shape adaptive ones
              do not have the same meaning.

       trell
              Trellis searched quantization.  This will find the  optimal  en-
              coding  for  each  8x8  block.  Trellis searched quantization is
              quite simply an optimal quantization in the PSNR versus  bitrate
              sense  (Assuming  that  there would be no rounding errors intro-
              duced by the IDCT, which is obviously not the case.).  It simply
              finds a block for the minimum of error and lambda*bits.
                 lambda
                      quantization parameter (QP) dependent constant
                 bits
                      amount of bits needed to encode the block
                 error
                      sum of squared errors of the quantization

       cbp
              Rate  distorted  optimal  coded  block pattern.  Will select the
              coded block pattern which minimizes  distortion  +  lambda*rate.
              This can only be used together with trellis quantization.

       mv0
              Try  to  encode each MB with MV=<0,0> and choose the better one.
              This has no effect if mbd=0.

       mv0_threshold=<any non-negative integer>
              When surrounding motion vectors are <0,0> and the motion estima-
              tion  score  of  the  current  block is less than mv0_threshold,
              <0,0> is used for the motion vector and further  motion  estima-
              tion is skipped (default: 256).  Lowering mv0_threshold to 0 can
              give a slight (0.01dB) PSNR increase and possibly make  the  en-
              coded video look slightly better; raising mv0_threshold past 320
              results in diminished PSNR and visual  quality.   Higher  values
              speed up encoding very slightly (usually less than 1%, depending
              on the other options used).
              NOTE: This option does not require mv0 to be enabled.

       qprd (mbd=2 only)

       refs=<1-8>
              number  of  reference frames to consider for motion compensation
              (Snow only) (default: 1)

       psnr
              print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole  video
              after  encoding  and  store  the per frame PSNR in a file with a
              name like 'psnr_hhmmss.log'.  Returned values are in  dB  (deci-
              bel), the higher the better.

       mpeg_quant
              Use MPEG quantizers instead of H.263.

       aic
              Enable AC prediction for MPEG-4 or advanced intra prediction for
              H.263+.  This will improve quality very slightly (around 0.02 dB
              PSNR) and slow down encoding very slightly (about 1%).
              NOTE: vqmin should be 8 or larger for H.263+ AIC.

       aiv
              alternative inter vlc for H.263+

       umv

              fault: 0, H.263 style quantizer default: -64)
              NOTE: The H.263 MMX quantizer cannot handle positive biases (set
              vfdct=1 or 2), the MPEG MMX quantizer cannot handle negative bi-
              ases (set vfdct=1 or 2).
              HINT: A more positive bias (-32 - -16 instead of -64)  seems  to
              improve the PSNR.

       nr=<0-100000>
              Noise  reduction, 0 means disabled.  0-600 is a useful range for
              typical content, but you may want to turn it up a bit  more  for
              very  noisy  content  (default:  0).   Given its small impact on
              speed, you might want to prefer to use this over filtering noise
              away with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

       qns=<0-3>
              Quantizer  noise  shaping.  Rather than choosing quantization to
              most closely match the source video in the PSNR sense, it choos-
              es quantization such that noise (usually ringing) will be masked
              by similar-frequency content in the image.   Larger  values  are
              slower  but  may  not  result  in  better quality.  This can and
              should be used together with trellis quantization, in which case
              the  trellis  quantization (optimal for constant weight) will be
              used as startpoint for the iterative search.
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    Only lower the absolute value of coefficients.
                 2    Only change coefficients before the last non-zero  coef-
                      ficient + 1.
                 3    Try all.

       inter_matrix=<comma separated matrix>
              Use  custom  inter matrix.  It needs a comma separated string of
              64 integers.

       intra_matrix=<comma separated matrix>
              Use custom intra matrix.  It needs a comma separated  string  of
              64 integers.

       vqmod_amp
              experimental quantizer modulation

       vqmod_freq
              experimental quantizer modulation

       dc
              intra  DC  precision  in  bits  (default:  8).   If  you specify
              vcodec=mpeg2video this value can be 8, 9, 10 or 11.

       cgop (also see sc_threshold)
              Close all GOPs.  Currently it only works if scene change  detec-
              tion is disabled (sc_threshold=1000000000).

       gmc
              Enable Global Motion Compensation.

       (no)lowdelay
              Sets the low delay flag for MPEG-1/2 (disables B-frames).

       vglobal=<0-3>
              Control writing global video headers.
                 0    Codec decides where to write global headers (default).
                 1    Write  global  headers  only  in  extradata  (needed for
                      .mp4/MOV/NUT).
                 2    Write global headers only in front of keyframes.
                 3    Combine 1 and 2.

       aglobal=<0-3>
              Same as vglobal for audio headers.

       level=<value>
              Set CodecContext Level.  Use  31  or  41  to  play  video  on  a
              Playstation 3.

   nuv (-nuvopts)
       Nuppel  video  is based on RTJPEG and LZO.  By default frames are first
       encoded with RTJPEG and then compressed with LZO, but it is possible to
       disable either or both of the two passes.  As a result, you can in fact
       output raw i420, LZO compressed i420, RTJPEG, or the default  LZO  com-
       pressed RTJPEG.
       NOTE:  The nuvrec documentation contains some advice and examples about
       the settings to use for the most common TV encodings.

       c=<0-20>
              chrominance threshold (default: 1)

       l=<0-20>
              luminance threshold (default: 1)

       lzo
              Enable LZO compression (default).

       nolzo
              Disable LZO compression.

       q=<3-255>
              quality level (default: 255)

       raw
              Disable RTJPEG encoding.

       rtjpeg
              Enable RTJPEG encoding (default).

   xvidenc (-xvidencopts)
       There are three modes available: constant bitrate (CBR), fixed quantiz-
       er and two pass.

       pass=<1|2>
              Specify the pass in two pass mode.

       turbo (two pass only)
              Dramatically speeds up pass one using faster algorithms and dis-
              abling CPU-intensive options.  This will probably reduce  global
              PSNR  a  little  bit and change individual frame type and PSNR a
              little bit more.

       bitrate=<value> (CBR or two pass mode)
              Sets the bitrate to be used in  kbits/second  if  <16000  or  in
              bits/second  if  >16000.   If <value> is negative, Xvid will use
              its absolute value as the target size (in kBytes) of  the  video
              and  compute  the associated bitrate automagically (default: 687
              kbits/s).

       fixed_quant=<1-31>
              Switch to fixed quantizer mode and specify the quantizer  to  be
              used.

       zones=<zone0>[/<zone1>[/...]] (CBR or two pass mode)
              User  specified  quality  for  specific  parts (ending, credits,
              ...).  Each zone is  <start-frame>,<mode>,<value>  where  <mode>
              may be
                 q    Constant quantizer override, where value=<2.0-31.0> rep-
                      resents the quantizer value.
                 w    Ratecontrol  weight  override,  where  value=<0.01-2.00>
                      represents the quality correction in %.

              EXAMPLE:
                 zones=90000,q,20
                      Encodes all frames starting with frame 90000 at constant
                      quantizer 20.
                 zones=0,w,0.1/10001,w,1.0/90000,q,20
                      Encode frames 0-10000  at  10%  bitrate,  encode  frames
                      90000 up to the end at constant quantizer 20.  Note that
                      the second zone is needed to delimit the first zone,  as
                      without  it everything up until frame 89999 would be en-
                      coded at 10% bitrate.

       me_quality=<0-6>
              This option controls the motion estimation subsystem.  The high-
              er  the  value,  the  more precise the estimation should be (de-
              fault: 6).  The more precise the motion estimation is, the  more
              bits  can  be  saved.  Precision is gained at the expense of CPU
              time so decrease this setting if you need realtime encoding.

       (no)qpel
              MPEG-4 uses a half pixel precision for its motion search by  de-
              fault.   The standard proposes a mode where encoders are allowed
              to use quarter pixel precision.  This option usually results  in
              a sharper image.  Unfortunately it has a great impact on bitrate
              and sometimes the higher bitrate use will prevent it from giving
              a better image quality at a fixed bitrate.  It is better to test
              with and without this option and see whether it is  worth  acti-
              vating.

       (no)gmc
              Enable  Global  Motion  Compensation,  which makes Xvid generate
              special frames (GMC-frames) which are well suited for  Pan/Zoom/
              Rotating  images.   Whether  or  not the use of this option will
              save bits is highly dependent on the source material.

       (no)trellis
              Trellis Quantization is a kind of adaptive  quantization  method
              that saves bits by modifying quantized coefficients to make them
              more compressible by the entropy encoder.  Its impact on quality
              is  good, and if VHQ uses too much CPU for you, this setting can
              be a good alternative to save a few bits (and  gain  quality  at
              fixed bitrate) at a lesser cost than with VHQ (default: on).

       (no)cartoon
              Activate  this if your encoded sequence is an anime/cartoon.  It
              modifies some Xvid internal thresholds so Xvid takes better  de-
              cisions  on frame types and motion vectors for flat looking car-
              toons.

       (no)chroma_me
              The usual motion estimation algorithm uses  only  the  luminance
              information  to  find  the best motion vector.  However for some
              video material, using the chroma planes  can  help  find  better
              vectors.   This setting toggles the use of chroma planes for mo-
              tion estimation (default: on).

       (no)chroma_opt
              Enable a chroma optimizer prefilter.  It will do some extra mag-
              ic on color information to minimize the stepped-stairs effect on
              edges.  It will improve quality at the cost of  encoding  speed.
              It  reduces PSNR by nature, as the mathematical deviation to the
              original picture will get bigger, but the subjective image qual-
              ity  will  raise.   Since  it  works with color information, you
              might want to turn it off when encoding in grayscale.

       (no)hq_ac
              Activates high-quality prediction of AC coefficients  for  intra
              frames from neighbor blocks (default: on).

       vhq=<0-4>
              The  motion  search  algorithm is based on a search in the usual
              color domain and tries to find a motion  vector  that  minimizes
              the  difference  between  the  reference  frame  and the encoded
              frame.  With this setting activated, Xvid will also use the fre-
              quency domain (DCT) to search for a motion vector that minimizes
              not only the spatial difference but also the encoding length  of
              the block.  Fastest to slowest:
                 0    off
                 1    mode decision (inter/intra MB) (default)
                 2    limited search
                 3    medium search
                 4    wide search

       (no)lumi_mask
              Adaptive  quantization  allows the macroblock quantizers to vary
              inside each frame.  This is a 'psychosensory'  setting  that  is
              supposed to make use of the fact that the human eye tends to no-
              tice fewer details in very bright and very  dark  parts  of  the
              picture.   It  compresses  those areas more strongly than medium
              ones, which will save bits that can  be  spent  again  on  other
              frames, raising overall subjective quality and possibly reducing
              PSNR.

       (no)grayscale
              Make  Xvid  discard  chroma  planes  so  the  encoded  video  is
              grayscale  only.   Note that this does not speed up encoding, it
              just prevents chroma data from being written in the  last  stage
              of encoding.

       (no)interlacing
              Encode  the  fields of interlaced video material.  Turn this op-
              tion on for interlaced content.
              NOTE: Should you rescale the video, you would need an interlace-
              aware    resizer,    which    you    can   activate   with   -vf
              scale=<width>:<height>:1.

       min_iquant=<0-31>
              minimum I-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_iquant=<0-31>
              maximum I-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_pquant=<0-31>
              minimum P-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_pquant=<0-31>
              maximum P-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_bquant=<0-31>
              minimum B-frame quantizer (default: 2)

       max_bquant=<0-31>
              maximum B-frame quantizer (default: 31)

       min_key_interval=<value> (two pass only)
              minimum interval between keyframes (default: 0)

       max_key_interval=<value>
              maximum interval between keyframes (default: 10*fps)

       quant_type=<h263|mpeg>
              Sets the type of quantizer to use.  For high bitrates, you  will
              find  that MPEG quantization preserves more detail.  For low bi-
              trates, the smoothing of H.263 will give you less  block  noise.
              When using custom matrices, MPEG quantization must be used.

       quant_intra_matrix=<filename>
              Load a custom intra matrix file.  You can build such a file with
              xvid4conf's matrix editor.

       quant_inter_matrix=<filename>
              Load a custom inter matrix file.  You can build such a file with
              xvid4conf's matrix editor.

       keyframe_boost=<0-1000> (two pass mode only)
              Shift  some  bits  from  the pool for other frame types to intra
              frames, thus improving keyframe quality.  This amount is an  ex-
              tra  percentage,  so  a value of 10 will give your keyframes 10%
              more bits than normal (default: 0).

       kfthreshold=<value> (two pass mode only)
              Works together with kfreduction.  Determines  the  minimum  dis-
              tance  below  which  you consider that two frames are considered
              consecutive and treated  differently  according  to  kfreduction
              (default: 10).

       kfreduction=<0-100> (two pass mode only)
              The  above  two  settings  can  be  used  to  adjust the size of
              keyframes that you consider too close to the first (in  a  row).
              kfthreshold  sets  the range in which keyframes are reduced, and
              kfreduction determines the bitrate reduction they get.  The last
              I-frame will get treated normally (default: 30).

       max_bframes=<0-4>
              Maximum  number  of B-frames to put between I/P-frames (default:
              2).

       bquant_ratio=<0-1000>
              quantizer ratio between B- and non-B-frames, 150=1.50  (default:
              150)

       bquant_offset=<-1000-1000>
              quantizer offset between B- and non-B-frames, 100=1.00 (default:
              100)

       bf_threshold=<-255-255>
              This setting allows you to specify what priority to place on the
              use of B-frames.  The higher the value, the higher the probabil-
              ity of B-frames being used (default: 0).  Do not forget that  B-
              frames usually have a higher quantizer, and therefore aggressive
              production of B-frames may cause worse visual quality.

       (no)closed_gop
              This option tells Xvid to close every  GOP  (Group  Of  Pictures
              bounded by two I-frames), which makes GOPs independent from each
              other.  This just implies that the last frame of the GOP is  ei-
              ther  a P-frame or a N-frame but not a B-frame.  It is usually a
              good idea to turn this option on (default: on).

       (no)packed
              This option is meant to solve frame-order issues  when  encoding
              to container formats like AVI that cannot cope with out-of-order
              frames.  In practice, most decoders (both software and hardware)
              are  able  to deal with frame-order themselves, and may get con-
              fused when this option is turned on, so you can safely leave  if
              off, unless you really know what you are doing.
              WARNING:  This  will generate an illegal bitstream, and will not
              be decodable by ISO-MPEG-4 decoders except DivX/libavcodec/Xvid.
              WARNING: This will also store a fake DivX version in the file so
              the bug autodetection of some decoders might be confused.

       frame_drop_ratio=<0-100> (max_bframes=0 only)
              This setting allows the creation  of  variable  framerate  video
              streams.   The  value of the setting specifies a threshold under
              which, if the difference of the following frame to the  previous
              frame is below or equal to this threshold, a frame gets not cod-
              ed (a so called n-vop is placed in the  stream).   On  playback,
              when reaching an n-vop the previous frame will be displayed.
              WARNING:  Playing with this setting may result in a jerky video,
              so use it at your own risks!

       rc_reaction_delay_factor=<value>
              This parameter controls the number of frames the CBR  rate  con-
              troller will wait before reacting to bitrate changes and compen-
              sating for them to obtain a constant bitrate over  an  averaging
              range of frames.

       rc_averaging_period=<value>
              Real  CBR  is hard to achieve.  Depending on the video material,
              bitrate can be variable, and hard to  predict.   Therefore  Xvid
              uses  an averaging period for which it guarantees a given amount
              of bits (minus a small variation).  This settings expresses  the
              "number  of frames" for which Xvid averages bitrate and tries to
              achieve CBR.

       rc_buffer=<value>
              size of the rate control buffer

       curve_compression_high=<0-100>
              This setting allows Xvid to take a certain  percentage  of  bits
              away  from  high  bitrate  scenes  and give them back to the bit
              reservoir.  You could also use this if you have a clip  with  so
              many  bits allocated to high-bitrate scenes that the low(er)-bi-
              trate scenes start to look bad (default: 0).

       curve_compression_low=<0-100>
              This setting allows Xvid to give a certain percentage  of  extra
              bits  to  the low bitrate scenes, taking a few bits from the en-
              tire clip.  This might come in handy if you have a  few  low-bi-
              trate scenes that are still blocky (default: 0).

       overflow_control_strength=<0-100>
              During  pass one of two pass encoding, a scaled bitrate curve is
              computed.  The difference between that expected  curve  and  the
              result  obtained during encoding is called overflow.  Obviously,
              the two pass rate controller tries to compensate for that  over-
              flow,  distributing  it over the next frames.  This setting con-
              trols how much of the overflow is distributed every  time  there
              is  a  new  frame.   Low values allow lazy overflow control, big
              rate bursts are compensated for more slowly (could lead to  lack
              of  precision for small clips).  Higher values will make changes
              in bit redistribution more abrupt, possibly too  abrupt  if  you
              set it too high, creating artifacts (default: 5).
              NOTE:  This setting impacts quality a lot, play with it careful-
              ly!

       max_overflow_improvement=<0-100>
              During the frame bit allocation, overflow control  may  increase
              the frame size.  This parameter specifies the maximum percentage
              by which the overflow control is allowed to increase  the  frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       max_overflow_degradation=<0-100>
              During  the  frame bit allocation, overflow control may decrease
              the frame size.  This parameter specifies the maximum percentage
              by  which  the overflow control is allowed to decrease the frame
              size, compared to the ideal curve allocation (default: 5).

       container_frame_overhead=<0...>
              Specifies a frame average overhead per frame, in bytes.  Most of
              the time users express their target bitrate for video w/o taking
              care of the video container overhead.  This small  but  (mostly)
              constant overhead can cause the target file size to be exceeded.
              Xvid allows users to set the amount of overhead  per  frame  the
              container  generates  (give only an average per frame).  0 has a
              special meaning, it lets Xvid use its own  default  values  (de-
              fault: 24 - AVI average overhead).

       profile=<profile_name>
              Restricts options and VBV (peak bitrate over a short period) ac-
              cording to the Simple, Advanced Simple and DivX  profiles.   The
              resulting videos should be playable on standalone players adher-
              ing to these profile specifications.

              NOTE: These profiles should be used in conjunction with  an  ap-
              propriate -ffourcc.  Generally DX50 is applicable, as some play-
              ers do not recognize Xvid but most recognize DivX.

       par=<mode>
              Specifies the Pixel Aspect Ratio mode (not to be  confused  with
              DAR,  the  Display Aspect Ratio).  PAR is the ratio of the width
              and height of a single pixel.  So both are  related  like  this:
              DAR = PAR * (width/height).
              MPEG-4  defines 5 pixel aspect ratios and one extended one, giv-
              ing the opportunity to specify a specific pixel aspect ratio.  5
              standard modes can be specified:
                 vga11
                      It is the usual PAR for PC content.  Pixels are a square
                      unit.
                 pal43
                      PAL standard 4:3 PAR.  Pixels are rectangles.
                 pal169
                      same as above
                 ntsc43
                      same as above
                 ntsc169
                      same as above (Do not forget to give the exact ratio.)
                 ext
                      Allows you to specify your own pixel aspect  ratio  with
                      par_width and par_height.
              NOTE:  In  general,  setting  aspect  and  autoaspect options is
              enough.

       par_width=<1-255> (par=ext only)
              Specifies the width of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       par_height=<1-255> (par=ext only)
              Specifies the height of the custom pixel aspect ratio.

       aspect=<x/y | f (float value)>
              Store movie aspect internally, just like MPEG files.  Much nicer
              solution  than  rescaling,  because  quality  is  not decreased.
              MPlayer and a few others players will play these files  correct-
              ly,  others will display them with the wrong aspect.  The aspect
              parameter can be given as a ratio or a floating point number.

       (no)autoaspect
              Same as the aspect option, but  automatically  computes  aspect,
              taking into account all the adjustments (crop/expand/scale/etc.)
              made in the filter chain.

       psnr
              Print the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) for the whole  video
              after  encoding  and  store  the per frame PSNR in a file with a
              name like 'psnr_hhmmss.log' in the current directory.   Returned
              values are in dB (decibel), the higher the better.

       debug
              Save  per-frame  statistics  in ./xvid.dbg. (This is not the two
              pass control file.)


       The following option is only available in Xvid 1.1.x.

       bvhq=<0|1>
              This setting allows vector candidates for B-frames  to  be  used
              for the encoding chosen using a rate distortion optimized opera-
              tor, which is what is done for P-frames by the vhq option.  This
              produces  nicer-looking  B-frames while incurring almost no per-
              formance penalty (default: 1).


       The following option is only available in the 1.2.x version of Xvid.

       threads=<0-n>
              Create n threads to run the motion estimation (default: 0).  The
              maximum number of threads that can be used is the picture height
              divided by 16.

   x264enc (-x264encopts)
       bitrate=<value>
              Sets the average bitrate to be used  in  kbits/second  (default:
              off).  Since local bitrate may vary, this average may be inaccu-
              rate for very short videos (see ratetol).  Constant bitrate  can
              be  achieved  by combining this with vbv_maxrate, at significant
              reduction in quality.

       qp=<0-51>
              This selects the quantizer to use for P-frames.  I- and B-frames
              are  offset  from this value by ip_factor and pb_factor, respec-
              tively.  20-40 is a useful range.  Lower values result in better
              fidelity,  but higher bitrates.  0 is lossless.  Note that quan-
              tization in H.264 works  differently  from  MPEG-1/2/4:  H.264's
              quantization parameter (QP) is on a logarithmic scale.  The map-
              ping is approximately H264QP = 12 + 6*log2(MPEGQP).   For  exam-
              ple, MPEG at QP=2 is equivalent to H.264 at QP=18.

       crf=<1.0-50.0>
              Enables  constant  quality  mode,  and selects the quality.  The
              scale is similar to QP.  Like the bitrate-based modes, this  al-
              lows  each frame to use a different QP based on the frame's com-
              plexity.

       pass=<1-3>
              Enable 2 or 3-pass mode.  It is recommended to always encode  in
              2  or  3-pass  mode as it leads to a better bit distribution and
              improves overall quality.
                 1    first pass
                 2    second pass (of two pass encoding)
                 3    Nth pass (second and third passes of three  pass  encod-
                      ing)
              Here is how it works, and how to use it:
              The  first  pass  (pass=1)  collects statistics on the video and
              writes them to a file.  You might want to deactivate  some  CPU-
              hungry options, apart from the ones that are on by default.
              In  two pass mode, the second pass (pass=2) reads the statistics
              file and bases ratecontrol decisions on it.
              In three pass mode, the second pass (pass=3, that is not a typo)
              does  both: It first reads the statistics, then overwrites them.
              You can use all encoding options,  except  very  CPU-hungry  op-
              tions.
              The  third  pass (pass=3) is the same as the second pass, except
              that it has the second pass' statistics to work from.   You  can
              use all encoding options, including CPU-hungry ones.
              The  first pass may use either average bitrate or constant quan-
              tizer.  ABR is recommended, since it does not require guessing a
              quantizer.  Subsequent passes are ABR, and must specify bitrate.

       turbo=<0-2>
              Fast first pass mode.  During the first pass of a  two  or  more
              pass  encode  it is possible to gain speed by disabling some op-
              tions with negligible or even no impact on the final pass output
              quality.
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    Reduce  subq, frameref and disable some inter-macroblock
                      partition analysis modes.
                 2    Reduce subq and frameref to 1, use a diamond  ME  search
                      and disable all partition analysis modes.
              Level 1 can increase first pass speed up to 2x with no change in
              the global PSNR of the final pass compared  to  a  full  quality
              first pass.
              Level  2  can  increase first pass speed up to 4x with about +/-
              0.05dB change in the global PSNR of the final pass compared to a
              full quality first pass.

       keyint=<value>
              Sets maximum interval between IDR-frames (default: 250).  Larger
              values save bits, thus improve quality, at the cost  of  seeking
              precision.   Unlike  MPEG-1/2/4,  H.264 does not suffer from DCT
              drift with large values of keyint.

       keyint_min=<1-keyint/2>
              Sets minimum interval  between  IDR-frames  (default:  25).   If
              scenecuts appear within this interval, they are still encoded as
              I-frames, but do not start a new GOP.  In H.264, I-frames do not
              necessarily  bound a closed GOP because it is allowable for a P-
              frame to be predicted from more frames than just the  one  frame
              before it (also see frameref).  Therefore, I-frames are not nec-
              essarily seekable.  IDR-frames restrict subsequent P-frames from
              referring to any frame prior to the IDR-frame.

       scenecut=<-1-100>
              Controls  how  aggressively  to  insert extra I-frames (default:
              40).  With small values of scenecut,  the  codec  often  has  to
              force  an  I-frame  when it would exceed keyint.  Good values of
              scenecut may find a better location for the I-frame.  Large val-
              ues  use  more  I-frames  than necessary, thus wasting bits.  -1
              disables scene-cut detection, so I-frames are inserted only once
              every  other  keyint frames, even if a scene-cut occurs earlier.
              This is not recommended and wastes bitrate as scenecuts  encoded
              as  P-frames  are  just as big as I-frames, but do not reset the
              "keyint counter".

       frameref=<1-16>
              Number of previous frames used as predictors in B- and  P-frames
              (default:  1).   This  is effective in anime, but in live-action
              material the improvements usually drop off very rapidly above  6
              or  so  reference frames.  This has no effect on decoding speed,
              but does increase the memory needed for decoding.  Some decoders
              can only handle a maximum of 15 reference frames.

       bframes=<0-16>
              maximum  number  of consecutive B-frames between I- and P-frames
              (default: 0)

       (no)b_adapt
              Automatically decides when to use B-frames and how many,  up  to
              the  maximum  specified  above (default: on).  If this option is
              disabled, then the maximum number of B-frames is used.

       b_bias=<-100-100>
              Controls the decision performed by  b_adapt.   A  higher  b_bias
              produces more B-frames (default: 0).

       (no)b_pyramid
              Allows  B-frames  to  be used as references for predicting other
              frames.  For example, consider 3 consecutive B-frames: I0 B1  B2
              B3 P4.  Without this option, B-frames follow the same pattern as
              MPEG-[124].  So they are coded in the order I0 P4 B1 B2 B3,  and
              all  the  B-frames  are predicted from I0 and P4.  With this op-
              tion, they are coded as I0 P4 B2 B1  B3.   B2  is  the  same  as
              above,  but  B1 is predicted from I0 and B2, and B3 is predicted
              from B2 and P4.  This usually results in slightly improved  com-
              pression,  at almost no speed cost.  However, this is an experi-
              mental option: it is not fully tuned and may  not  always  help.
              Requires  bframes  >= 2.  Disadvantage: increases decoding delay
              to 2 frames.

       (no)deblock
              Use deblocking filter (default: on).  As it  takes  very  little
              time compared to its quality gain, it is not recommended to dis-
              able it.

       deblock=<-6-6>,<-6-6>
              The first parameter  is  AlphaC0  (default:  0).   This  adjusts
              thresholds for the H.264 in-loop deblocking filter.  First, this
              parameter adjusts the maximum amount of change that  the  filter
              is  allowed to cause on any one pixel.  Secondly, this parameter
              affects the threshold for difference across the edge being  fil-
              tered.   A  positive  value reduces blocking artifacts more, but
              will also smear details.
              The second parameter is Beta (default: 0).  This affects the de-
              tail  threshold.   Very  detailed blocks are not filtered, since
              the smoothing caused by the filter would be more noticeable than
              the original blocking.
              The  default behavior of the filter almost always achieves opti-
              mal quality, so it is best to either leave it alone, or make on-
              ly  small adjustments.  However, if your source material already
              has some blocking or noise which you would like  to  remove,  it
              may be a good idea to turn it up a little bit.

       (no)cabac
              Use  CABAC (Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding) (default:
              on).  Slightly slows down encoding and decoding, but should save
              10-15%  bitrate.  Unless you are looking for decoding speed, you
              should not disable it.

       qp_min=<1-51> (ABR or two pass)
              Minimum quantizer, 10-30 seems to be a  useful  range  (default:
              10).

       qp_max=<1-51> (ABR or two pass)
              maximum quantizer (default: 51)

       qp_step=<1-50> (ABR or two pass)
              maximum  value  by which the quantizer may be incremented/decre-
              mented between frames (default: 4)

       ratetol=<0.1-100.0> (ABR or two pass)
              allowed variance in average bitrate (no particular  units)  (de-
              fault: 1.0)

       vbv_maxrate=<value> (ABR or two pass)
              maximum local bitrate, in kbits/second (default: disabled)

       vbv_bufsize=<value> (ABR or two pass)
              averaging  period for vbv_maxrate, in kbits (default: none, must
              be specified if vbv_maxrate is enabled)

       vbv_init=<0.0-1.0> (ABR or two pass)
              initial buffer occupancy, as a fraction of vbv_bufsize (default:
              0.9)

       ip_factor=<value>
              quantizer factor between I- and P-frames (default: 1.4)

       pb_factor=<value>
              quantizer factor between P- and B-frames (default: 1.3)

       qcomp=<0-1> (ABR or two pass)
              quantizer  compression  (default: 0.6).  A lower value makes the
              bitrate more constant, while a higher value makes the  quantiza-
              tion parameter more constant.

       cplx_blur=<0-999> (two pass only)
              Temporal  blur  of  the estimated frame complexity, before curve
              compression (default: 20).  Lower  values  allow  the  quantizer
              value  to  jump around more, higher values force it to vary more
              smoothly.  cplx_blur ensures that each I-frame has quality  com-
              parable  to the following P-frames, and ensures that alternating
              high and low complexity frames (e.g. low fps animation)  do  not
              waste bits on fluctuating quantizer.

       qblur=<0-99> (two pass only)
              Temporal  blur  of  the quantization parameter, after curve com-
              pression (default: 0.5).  Lower values allow the quantizer value
              to jump around more, higher values force it to vary more smooth-
              ly.

       zones=<zone0>[/<zone1>[/...]]
              User specified quality  for  specific  parts  (ending,  credits,
              ...).  Each zone is <start-frame>,<end-frame>,<option> where op-
              tion may be
                 q=<0-51>
                      quantizer
                 b=<0.01-100.0>
                      bitrate multiplier
              NOTE: The quantizer option is not strictly enforced.  It affects
              only  the planning stage of ratecontrol, and is still subject to
              overflow compensation and qp_min/qp_max.

       direct_pred=<name>
              Determines the type of motion prediction used  for  direct  mac-
              roblocks in B-frames.
                 none Direct macroblocks are not used.
                 spatial
                      Motion vectors are extrapolated from neighboring blocks.
                      (default)
                 temporal
                      Motion vectors are extrapolated from  the  following  P-
                      frame.
                 auto The  codec selects between spatial and temporal for each
                      frame.
              Spatial and temporal are approximately the same speed and  PSNR,
              the  choice  between them depends on the video content.  Auto is
              slightly better, but slower.  Auto is most effective  when  com-
              bined with multipass.  direct_pred=none is both slower and lower
              quality.

       (no)weight_b
              Use weighted prediction in B-frames.  Without this option, bidi-
              rectionally predicted macroblocks give equal weight to each ref-
              erence frame.  With this option, the weights are  determined  by
              the temporal position of the B-frame relative to the references.
              Requires bframes > 1.

       partitions=<list>
              Enable    some    optional    macroblock     types     (default:
              p8x8,b8x8,i8x8,i4x4).
                 p8x8 Enable types p16x8, p8x16, p8x8.
                 p4x4 Enable types p8x4, p4x8, p4x4.  p4x4 is recommended only
                      with subq >= 5, and only at low resolutions.
                 b8x8 Enable types b16x8, b8x16, b8x8.
                 i8x8 Enable type i8x8.  i8x8 has no effect unless  8x8dct  is
                      enabled.
                 i4x4 Enable type i4x4.
                 all  Enable all of the above types.
                 none Disable all of the above types.
              Regardless  of this option, macroblock types p16x16, b16x16, and
              i16x16 are always enabled.
              The idea is to find the type and size that best describe a  cer-
              tain  area  of the picture.  For example, a global pan is better
              represented by 16x16 blocks, while small moving objects are bet-
              ter represented by smaller blocks.

       (no)8x8dct
              Adaptive  spatial  transform  size: allows macroblocks to choose
              between 4x4 and 8x8 DCT.  Also allows the i8x8 macroblock  type.
              Without this option, only 4x4 DCT is used.

       me=<name>
              Select fullpixel motion estimation algorithm.
                 dia  diamond search, radius 1 (fast)
                 hex  hexagon search, radius 2 (default)
                 umh  uneven multi-hexagon search (slow)
                 esa  exhaustive search (very slow, and no better than umh)

       me_range=<4-64>
              radius  of  exhaustive  or multi-hexagon motion search (default:
              16)

       subq=<0-9>
              Adjust subpel refinement quality.  This parameter controls qual-
              ity versus speed tradeoffs involved in the motion estimation de-
              cision process.  subq=5 can  compress  up  to  10%  better  than
              subq=1.
                 0    Runs fullpixel precision motion estimation on all candi-
                      date macroblock types.  Then selects the best type  with
                      SAD  metric  (faster than subq=1, not recommended unless
                      you're looking for ultra-fast encoding).
                 1    Does as 0, then refines the motion of that type to  fast
                      quarterpixel precision (fast).
                 2    Runs halfpixel precision motion estimation on all candi-
                      date macroblock types.  Then selects the best type  with
                      SATD  metric.   Then  refines the motion of that type to
                      fast quarterpixel precision.
                 3    As 2, but uses a slower quarterpixel refinement.
                 4    Runs fast quarterpixel precision  motion  estimation  on
                      all  candidate  macroblock types.  Then selects the best
                      type with SATD metric.  Then finishes  the  quarterpixel
                      refinement for that type.
                 5    Runs  best quality quarterpixel precision motion estima-
                      tion on all candidate macroblock types, before selecting
                      the best type.  Also refines the two motion vectors used
                      in bidirectional macroblocks with  SATD  metric,  rather
                      than  reusing  vectors  from  the  forward  and backward
                      searches.
                 6    Enables rate-distortion optimization of macroblock types
                      in I- and P-frames (default).
                 7    Enables rate-distortion optimization of macroblock types
                      in all frames.
                 8    Enables rate-distortion optimization of  motion  vectors
                      and intra prediction modes in I- and P-frames.
                 9    Enables  rate-distortion  optimization of motion vectors
                      and intra prediction modes in all frames (best).
              In the above, "all candidates" does not exactly mean all enabled
              types: 4x4, 4x8, 8x4 are tried only if 8x8 is better than 16x16.

       (no)chroma_me
              Takes into account chroma  information  during  subpixel  motion
              search (default: enabled).  Requires subq>=5.

       (no)mixed_refs
              Allows each 8x8 or 16x8 motion partition to independently select
              a reference frame.  Without this option, a whole macroblock must
              use the same reference.  Requires frameref>1.

       trellis=<0-2> (cabac only)
              rate-distortion optimal quantization
                 0    disabled (default)
                 1    enabled only for the final encode
                 2    enabled   during  all  mode  decisions  (slow,  requires
                      subq>=6)

       psy-rd=rd[,trell]
              Sets the strength of the psychovisual optimization.
                 rd=<0.0-10.0>
                      psy optimization strength (requires  subq>=6)  (default:
                      1.0)
                 trell=<0.0-10.0>
                      trellis (requires trellis, experimental) (default: 0.0)

       deadzone_inter=<0-32>
              Set  the  size  of the inter luma quantization deadzone for non-
              trellis quantization (default: 21).  Lower values help  to  pre-
              serve fine details and film grain (typically useful for high bi-
              trate/quality encode), while higher values help filter out these
              details  to  save  bits  that  can  be spent again on other mac-
              roblocks and frames (typically useful  for  bitrate-starved  en-
              codes).   It  is  recommended  that  you start by tweaking dead-
              zone_intra before changing this parameter.

       deadzone_intra=<0-32>
              Set the size of the intra luma quantization  deadzone  for  non-
              trellis  quantization  (default:  11).  This option has the same
              effect as deadzone_inter except that it  affects  intra  frames.
              It  is recommended that you start by tweaking this parameter be-
              fore changing deadzone_inter.

       (no)fast_pskip
              Performs early skip detection in  P-frames  (default:  enabled).
              This  usually  improves  speed  at no cost, but it can sometimes
              produce artifacts in areas with no details, like sky.

       (no)dct_decimate
              Eliminate dct blocks in P-frames containing only a small  single
              coefficient  (default: enabled).  This will remove some details,
              so it will save bits that can be spent again  on  other  frames,
              hopefully  raising  overall subjective quality.  If you are com-
              pressing non-anime content with a high target bitrate,  you  may
              want to disable this to preserve as much detail as possible.

       nr=<0-100000>
              Noise  reduction,  0 means disabled.  100-1000 is a useful range
              for typical content, but you may want to turn it up a  bit  more
              for  very noisy content (default: 0).  Given its small impact on
              speed, you might want to prefer to use this over filtering noise
              away with video filters like denoise3d or hqdn3d.

       chroma_qp_offset=<-12-12>
              Use  a different quantizer for chroma as compared to luma.  Use-
              ful values are in the range <-2-2> (default: 0).

       aq_mode=<0-2>
              Defines how adaptive quantization (AQ) distributes bits:
                 0    disabled
                 1    Avoid moving bits between frames.
                 2    Move bits between frames (by default).

       aq_strength=<positive float value>
              Controls how much adaptive quantization  (AQ)  reduces  blocking
              and blurring in flat and textured areas (default: 1.0).  A value
              of 0.5 will lead to weak AQ and less details, when  a  value  of
              1.5 will lead to strong AQ and more details.

       cqm=<flat|jvt|<filename>>
              Either  uses  a predefined custom quantization matrix or loads a
              JM format matrix file.
                 flat
                      Use the predefined flat 16 matrix (default).
                 jvt
                      Use the predefined JVT matrix.
                 <filename>
                      Use the provided JM format matrix file.
              NOTE: Windows CMD.EXE users may experience problems with parsing
              the command line if they attempt to use all the CQM lists.  This
              is due to a command line length limitation.  In this case it  is
              recommended the lists be put into a JM format CQM file and load-
              ed as specified above.

       cqm4iy=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 intra luminance matrix, given as a list of  16  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4ic=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 intra chrominance matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4py=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 inter luminance matrix, given as a list of  16  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm4pc=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 4x4 inter chrominance matrix, given as a list of 16 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm8iy=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom 8x8 intra luminance matrix, given as a list of  64  comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       cqm8py=<list> (also see cqm)
              Custom  8x8  inter luminance matrix, given as a list of 64 comma
              separated values in the 1-255 range.

       level_idc=<10-51>
              Set the bitstream's level as defined by annex  A  of  the  H.264
              standard  (default:  51  - level 5.1).  This is used for telling
              the decoder what capabilities it needs to support.  Use this pa-
              rameter  only  if you know what it means, and you have a need to
              set it.

       threads=<0-16>
              Spawn threads to encode in parallel on multiple  CPUs  (default:
              1).   This  has  a  slight penalty to compression quality.  0 or
              'auto' tells x264 to detect how many CPUs you have and  pick  an
              appropriate number of threads.

       (no)global_header
              Causes  SPS and PPS to appear only once, at the beginning of the
              bitstream (default: disabled).  Some players, such as  the  Sony
              PSP, require the use of this option.  The default behavior caus-
              es SPS and PPS to repeat prior to each IDR frame.

       (no)interlaced
              Treat the video content as interlaced.

       log=<-1-3>
              Adjust the amount of logging info printed to the screen.
                 -1   none
                  0   Print errors only.
                  1   warnings
                  2   PSNR and other analysis statistics when the encode  fin-
                      ishes (default)
                  3   PSNR,  QP, frametype, size, and other statistics for ev-
                      ery frame

       (no)psnr
              Print signal-to-noise ratio statistics.
              NOTE: The 'Y', 'U', 'V', and 'Avg' PSNR fields  in  the  summary
              are  not  mathematically  sound  (they are simply the average of
              per-frame PSNRs).  They are kept only for comparison to  the  JM
              reference  codec.  For all other purposes, please use either the
              'Global' PSNR, or the per-frame PSNRs printed by log=3.

       (no)ssim
              Print the Structural Similarity Metric results.  This is an  al-
              ternative  to  PSNR,  and may be better correlated with the per-
              ceived quality of the compressed video.

       (no)visualize
              Enable x264 visualizations during encoding.  If the x264 on your
              system  supports  it, a new window will be opened during the en-
              coding process,  in  which  x264  will  attempt  to  present  an
              overview of how each frame gets encoded.  Each block type on the
              visualized movie will be colored as follows:
                 red/pink
                      intra block
                 blue
                      inter block
                 green
                      skip block
                 yellow
                      B-block
              This feature can  be  considered  experimental  and  subject  to
              change.   In  particular, it depends on x264 being compiled with
              visualizations enabled.  Note that  as  of  writing  this,  x264
              pauses  after  encoding  and visualizing each frame, waiting for
              the user to press a key, at which point the next frame  will  be
              encoded.

   xvfw (-xvfwopts)
       Encoding  with  Video  for Windows codecs is mostly obsolete unless you
       wish to encode to some obscure fringe codec.

       codec=<name>
              The name of the binary codec file with which to encode.

       compdata=<file>
              The name of the codec settings file (like firstpass.mcf) created
              by vfw2menc.

   MPEG muxer (-mpegopts)
       The  MPEG muxer can generate 5 types of streams, each of which has rea-
       sonable default parameters that the user can override.  Generally, when
       generating MPEG files, it is advisable to disable MEncoder's frame-skip
       code (see -noskip, -mc as well as the harddup and softskip  video  fil-
       ters).

       EXAMPLE:
                 format=mpeg2:tsaf:vbitrate=8000

       format=<mpeg1 | mpeg2 | xvcd | xsvcd | dvd | pes1 | pes2>
              stream  format  (default: mpeg2).  pes1 and pes2 are very broken
              formats (no pack header and no padding), but VDR uses  them;  do
              not choose them unless you know exactly what you are doing.

       size=<up to 65535>
              Pack  size  in bytes, do not change unless you know exactly what
              you are doing (default: 2048).

       muxrate=<int>
              Nominal muxrate in kbit/s used in  the  pack  headers  (default:
              1800  kb/s).   Will be updated as necessary in the case of 'for-
              mat=mpeg1' or 'mpeg2'.

       tsaf
              Sets timestamps on all frames,  if  possible;  recommended  when
              format=dvd.  If dvdauthor complains with a message like "..audio
              sector out of range...", you probably did not  enable  this  op-
              tion.

       interleaving2
              Uses  a  better algorithm to interleave audio and video packets,
              based on the principle that the muxer will always  try  to  fill
              the stream with the largest percentage of free space.

       vdelay=<1-32760>
              Initial  video  delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0), use it
              if you want to delay video with respect to  audio.   It  doesn't
              work with :drop.

       adelay=<1-32760>
              Initial  audio  delay time, in milliseconds (default: 0), use it
              if you want to delay audio with respect to video.

       drop
              When used with vdelay the muxer drops the part of audio that was
              anticipated.

       vwidth, vheight=<1-4095>
              Set the video width and height when video is MPEG-1/2.

       vpswidth, vpsheight=<1-4095>
              Set pan and scan video width and height when video is MPEG-2.

       vaspect=<1 | 4/3 | 16/9 | 221/100>
              Sets  the  display aspect ratio for MPEG-2 video.  Do not use it
              on MPEG-1 or the  resulting  aspect  ratio  will  be  completely
              wrong.

       vbitrate=<int>
              Sets the video bitrate in kbit/s for MPEG-1/2 video.

       vframerate=<24000/1001  | 24 | 25 | 30000/1001 | 30 | 50 | 60000/1001 |
       60 >
              Sets  the framerate for MPEG-1/2 video.  This option will be ig-
              nored if used with the telecine option.

       telecine
              Enables 3:2 pulldown soft telecine mode: The muxer will make the
              video stream look like it was encoded at 30000/1001 fps.  It on-
              ly  works  with  MPEG-2  video  when  the  output  framerate  is
              24000/1001  fps,  convert it with -ofps if necessary.  Any other
              framerate is incompatible with this option.

       film2pal
              Enables FILM to PAL and NTSC to PAL soft telecine mode: The mux-
              er  will  make  the  video stream look like it was encoded at 25
              fps.  It only works with MPEG-2 video when the output  framerate
              is 24000/1001 fps, convert it with -ofps if necessary.  Any oth-
              er framerate is incompatible with this option.

       tele_src and tele_dest
              Enables arbitrary telecining  using  Donand  Graft's  DGPulldown
              code.   You need to specify the original and the desired framer-
              ate; the muxer will make the video stream look like it  was  en-
              coded at the desired framerate.  It only works with MPEG-2 video
              when the input framerate is smaller than  the  output  framerate
              and the framerate increase is <= 1.5.

              EXAMPLE:
                 tele_src=25,tele_dest=30000/1001
                      PAL to NTSC telecining

       vbuf_size=<40-1194>
              Sets  the size of the video decoder's buffer, expressed in kilo-
              bytes.  Specify it only if the bitrate of the  video  stream  is
              too  high  for  the chosen format and if you know perfectly well
              what you are doing.  A too high value may lead to an  unplayable
              movie, depending on the player's capabilities.  When muxing HDTV
              video a value of 400 should suffice.

       abuf_size=<4-64>
              Sets the size of the audio decoder's buffer, expressed in  kilo-
              bytes.  The same principle as for vbuf_size applies.

   FFmpeg libavformat demuxers (-lavfdopts)
       analyzeduration=<value>
              Maximum length in seconds to analyze the stream properties.

       format=<value>
              Force a specific libavformat demuxer.

       o=<key>=<value>[,<key>=<value>[,...]]
              Pass  AVOptions  to  libavformat demuxer.  Note, a patch to make
              the o= unneeded and pass all unknown options through  the  AVOp-
              tion  system  is welcome.  A full list of AVOptions can be found
              in the FFmpeg manual.  Note that some options may conflict  with
              MPlayer/MEncoder options.

              EXAMPLE:
                 o=ignidx

       probesize=<value>
              Maximum  amount of data to probe during the detection phase.  In
              the case of MPEG-TS this value identifies the maximum number  of
              TS packets to scan.

       cryptokey=<hexstring>
              Encryption  key  the demuxer should use.  This is the raw binary
              data of the key converted to a hexadecimal string.

   FFmpeg libavformat muxers (-lavfopts) (also see -of lavf)
       delay=<value>
              Currently only meaningful for  MPEG[12]:  Maximum  allowed  dis-
              tance,  in  seconds,  between  the reference timer of the output
              stream (SCR) and the decoding timestamp  (DTS)  for  any  stream
              present (demux to decode delay).  Default is 0.7 (as mandated by
              the standards defined by MPEG).  Higher  values  require  larger
              buffers and must not be used.

       format=<container_format>
              Override which container format to mux into (default: autodetect
              from output file extension).

       muxrate=<rate>
              Nominal  bitrate of the multiplex, in bits per second; currently
              it is meaningful only for MPEG[12].   Sometimes  raising  it  is
              necessary in order to avoid "buffer underflows".

       o=<key>=<value>[,<key>=<value>[,...]]
              Pass  AVOptions to libavformat muxer.  Note, a patch to make the
              o= unneeded and pass all unknown options  through  the  AVOption
              system is welcome.  A full list of AVOptions can be found in the
              FFmpeg manual.  Note that some options may  conflict  with  MEn-
              coder options.

              EXAMPLE:
                 o=packetsize=100

       packetsize=<size>
              Size,  expressed  in bytes, of the unitary packet for the chosen
              format.  When muxing to  MPEG[12]  implementations  the  default
              values are: 2324 for [S]VCD, 2048 for all others formats.

       preload=<distance>
              Currently  only  meaningful  for  MPEG[12]: Initial distance, in
              seconds, between the reference timer of the output stream  (SCR)
              and  the  decoding timestamp (DTS) for any stream present (demux
              to decode delay).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control
       the behavior of MPlayer and MEncoder.

       MPLAYER_CHARSET (also see -msgcharset)
              Convert  console messages to the specified charset (default: au-
              todetect).  A value of "noconv" means no conversion.

       MPLAYER_HOME
              Directory where MPlayer looks for user settings.

       MPLAYER_VERBOSE (also see -v and -msglevel)
              Set the initial verbosity level across all message modules  (de-
              fault:  0).  The resulting verbosity corresponds to that of -ms-
              glevel 5 plus the value of MPLAYER_VERBOSE.

   libaf:
       LADSPA_PATH
              If LADSPA_PATH is set, it searches for the specified  file.   If
              it  is  not  set,  you  must  supply a fully specified pathname.
              FIXME: This is also mentioned in the ladspa section.

   libdvdcss:
       DVDCSS_CACHE
              Specify a directory in which to store title  key  values.   This
              will  speed up descrambling of DVDs which are in the cache.  The
              DVDCSS_CACHE directory is created if it does not  exist,  and  a
              subdirectory  is created named after the DVD's title or manufac-
              turing date.  If DVDCSS_CACHE is not set or is empty,  libdvdcss
              will  use  the  default  value which is "${HOME}/.dvdcss/" under
              Unix and "C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application Data\dvdc-
              ss\" under Win32.  The special value "off" disables caching.

       DVDCSS_METHOD
              Sets  the  authentication  and  decryption method that libdvdcss
              will use to read scrambled discs.  Can be one of title,  key  or
              disc.
                 key
                      is the default method.  libdvdcss will use a set of cal-
                      culated player keys to try and get the disc  key.   This
                      can  fail  if  the  drive  does not recognize any of the
                      player keys.
                 disc
                      is a fallback method when key has  failed.   Instead  of
                      using player keys, libdvdcss will crack the disc key us-
                      ing a brute force algorithm.  This process is CPU inten-
                      sive and requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary da-
                      ta.
                 title
                      is the fallback when all other methods have failed.   It
                      does  not rely on a key exchange with the DVD drive, but
                      rather uses a crypto attack to guess the title key.   On
                      rare cases this may fail because there is not enough en-
                      crypted data on the disc to perform  a  statistical  at-
                      tack,  but  in  the other hand it is the only way to de-
                      crypt a DVD stored on a hard disc, or  a  DVD  with  the
                      wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

       DVDCSS_RAW_DEVICE
              Specify  the raw device to use.  Exact usage will depend on your
              operating system, the Linux utility to set  up  raw  devices  is
              raw(8)  for  instance.   Please note that on most operating sys-
              tems, using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers:  Linux
              requires a 2048 bytes alignment (which is the size of a DVD sec-
              tor).

       DVDCSS_VERBOSE
              Sets the libdvdcss verbosity level.
                 0    Outputs no messages at all.
                 1    Outputs error messages to stderr.
                 2    Outputs error messages and debug messages to stderr.

       DVDREAD_NOKEYS
              Skip retrieving all keys on startup.  Currently disabled.

       AUDIODEV
              FIXME: Document this.

       AUDIOSERVER
              Specifies the Network Audio System server to which the nas audio
              output  driver  should  connect and the transport that should be
              used.  If unset DISPLAY is used instead.  The transport  can  be
              one  of  tcp  and  unix.   Syntax  is tcp/<somehost>:<someport>,
              <somehost>:<instancenumber> or [unix]:<instancenumber>.  The NAS
              base port is 8000 and <instancenumber> is added to that.

              EXAMPLES:
                 AUDIOSERVER=somehost:0
                      Connect to NAS server on somehost using default port and
                      transport.
                 AUDIOSERVER=tcp/somehost:8000
                      Connect to NAS server on somehost listening on TCP  port
                      8000.
                 AUDIOSERVER=(unix)?:0
                      Connect to NAS server instance 0 on localhost using unix
                      domain sockets.

       mplayer /dev/zero -rawvideo pal:fps=xx -demuxer rawvideo -vc null -vo null -noframedrop -benchmark -sub source.sub -dumpmpsub

       input from standard V4L:
       mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l:width=640:height=480:outfmt=i420 -vc rawi420 -vo xv

       Playback on Zoran cards (old style, deprecated):
       mplayer -vo zr -vf scale=352:288 file.avi

       Playback on Zoran cards (new style):
       mplayer -vo zr2 -vf scale=352:288,zrmjpeg file.avi

       Play DTS-CD with passthrough:
       mplayer -ac hwdts -rawaudio format=0x2001 -cdrom-device /dev/cdrom cdda://
       You  can also use -afm hwac3 instead of -ac hwdts.  Adjust '/dev/cdrom'
       to match the CD-ROM device on your system.  If your  external  receiver
       supports decoding raw DTS streams, you can directly play it via cdda://
       without setting format, hwac3 or hwdts.

       Play a 6-channel AAC file with only two speakers:
       mplayer -rawaudio format=0xff -demuxer rawaudio -af pan=2:.32:.32:.39:.06:.06:.39:.17:-.17:-.17:.17:.33:.33 adts_he-aac160_51.aac
       You might want to play a bit with the pan values (e.g multiply  with  a
       value) to increase volume or avoid clipping.

       checkerboard invert with geq filter:
       mplayer -vf geq='128+(p(XY)-128)*(0.5-gt(mod(X/SW128)64))*(0.5-gt(mod(Y/SH128)64))*4'
