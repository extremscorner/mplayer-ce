MPlayer CE is an unofficial  port of the  very popular multimedia  player for
various  platforms  including  Windows  and  Linux.  This  Nintendo Wii  port 
features the same compatibility that the other versions offer, but is limited
in some aspects  as it can't playback  some high resolution videos due to the
processing power of the Wii.

MPlayer CE will  allow you to  watch various  movies in different  formats on 
your  Nintendo Wii  including AVI,  DIVX,  XVID,  MPEG2  and  DVD  Videos. It 
actually supports a huge  range of formats  and can playback media from DVDs,
SD Cards, USB drives  and over your local  area  network  using  Samba  (SMB)
shares. MPlayer CE also  allows  you  to  listen  to  radio  streams over the 
Internet.

This port is  based on the original work of  Team Twiizer's  MPlayer Wii port 
and uses code from [rOn]'s  MPlayer Wii port along with code from GeeXbox. It 
is currently  maintained by Scip, tipolosko, rodries, AgentX & DJDynamite123.

While there are  numerous ports and versions  of MPlayer for the Nintendo Wii 
its hard to  tell which  one to use, but  this one is being heavily developed 
and surpases  the other versions  due to its  performance, optimizations  and 
features.

To run MPlayer CE you'll need a Nintendo Wii that has been "soft modded" with
either  the  Homebrew  Channel,  Homebrew  Launcher  or LoadMii.  The archive  
contains a folder  named "MPlayer_ce"  which  you will  need  to copy to your
"apps" folder  on your SD Card. 
Once  copied  over you  can launch it  using the  loader of your choice.

USB 2.0:
You need to  install the  USB 2.0 cIOS from http://wiibrew.org/wiki/CIOS_usb2
You must then then reinstall DVDX http://wiibrew.org/wiki/DVDx using advanced
mode and selecting IOS202.   Even  if you don't  plan on playing DVDs this is
necessary for MPlayer CE to detect if the cIOS is installed.

Plug in your USB device before loading MPlayer, and it should be mounted.
Some devices do not support hotplugging.

Users  with  system menu 3.4 or  higher will not be  able to use  USB2.0 with
MPlayerCE because the DVDx installer for 3.4 does not have an  advanced mode.
Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it.

If you plan on updating make sure to install the cIOS and DVDx before updating.

|0O×øo·                            CONFIGURATION                      ·oø×O0|
`¨•¨¨¨¨¨ ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨ ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨ ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨ ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨'

In the "MPlayer_ce" folder you copied over to your SD card you will find some
.conf files  which can  alter the way  MPlayer operates  and is also  used to 
setup your SMB shares. MPlayer CE has  the ability to use  five different SMB
shares, but they  must be configured manually by editing the "smb.conf" file.
Inside of  it you'll find  five different  entries.  You can  fill in as many 
shares as you like. The format is as follows:

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip1=192.168.0.1
share1=Movies
user1=Test
pass1=fr0g

The "ip1" is your  computer's  IP address,  the "share1"  is the name of your 
shared folder, "user1" is the  username you use to login to your computer and
lastly "pass1" is your password  you use to login to your computer. If you do
not use a username and password,  leave  user1  and  pass1  blank,  "user1=",
"pass1=" so MPlayer CE knows not to use a password to login to your SMB share.

If your share folder has a space in it, you must surround  it  with quotation
marks: share1="My Movies".

You can also force the aspect ratio of  the screen. This means that all video
files will be displayed at the specified ratio.  To force 16/9 you will  need
to edit the "mplayer.conf" file and add the following line:

"ratio=1.7778" (add it without the quotes)

Lastly, if you wish to change the  background image you can create  your own.
After creating a custom background  (it can be a still image or an animation)
convert it to a video, name it "loop.avi" and place it  in  the  "MPlayer_ce"
folder.  The specifications for "loop.avi" are listed below.

XVID MPEG4 Compressed AVI
640x456 or 720x480 Resolution

The Nintendo Wii is capable of reading DVD DATA and DVD-VIDEO discs, but this
functionality  while  left  into  the  Nintendo  Wii  needs  to be enabled by 
installing  DVDx from  Team Twiizers.  You  can  locate  DVDx  from  the URLs 
below.  Make sure to install  the  correct version as there is one for System
Menu 3.2/3.3 and one for 3.4
